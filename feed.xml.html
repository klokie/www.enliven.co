A company far more devoted to drivers
  than any other.</p>

  <p>Born in Sweden and raised by polish parents, living semi-annually in Tuscany and Poland, Peter Ternstr&ouml;m is a
  man of many cultures. He is a published author of books and travel guides, columnist in magazines and an avid private
  pilot. Besides this, he is also a passionate supercar enthusiast as well as the founder of the famous supercar event
  organiser Gran Turismo Events.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>High-end supercar events for the world&rsquo;s top 1 per cent</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Since 2002, Peter and his team has been organising high-end events on famous racing tracks and road trips on the most
  beautiful roads in the world. The events include exclusive days on famous racing tracks like the N&uuml;rburgring and
  Spa-Francorchamps. Their track events are famous for their relaxed atmosphere and gentleman driving style.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Among the most popular events are the Weekend escapes, short driving events during two or three days, in Italy, on
  the Riviera or the Alps. Fantastic roads and luxury hotels compressed in a weekend escape format. For your convenience,
  a supercar of your choice is included. Fly in, enjoy a weekend in a convertible Ferrari on the Riviera, and fly
  home.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>a cup of double espresso</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It was during a weekend escape as such, looking over the beautiful landscapes of Tuscany (and his Lamborghini
  Hurac&aacute;n), Peter Ternstr&ouml;m found that there was something missing to the scenery. Behind a cup of double
  espresso, he began to dream of a watch to accompany him during these precious moments in life. This led Peter to turn to
  his dear friend and watch engineer Mikael Sandstr&ouml;m. As Peter preached about the timepiece he imagined, Mikael
  teamed up with his old partner Christer Sj&ouml;&ouml;. Together they created a vintage inspired watch equally suiting
  both on, or off, the track. A perfect watch for the gentlemen drivers of Gran Turismo.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>two racing chronographs</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After months of sketches, revisions and material testing, Gran Turismo have now presented two racing chronographs,
  each exclusively made in a limited series of 50 numbered units. The watches are produced in stainless steel with a
  sapphire crystal that will withstand a water pressure equivalent of 100 meter. They have a diameter of 40 mm and are
  fitted with a Swiss quartz engine. The Gran Turismo watches come with a classic racing strap in genuine leather or
  bracelet in stainless steel, and are delivered in a wooden gift box.</p>

  <p>The Halda Watch Company dates back nearly 130 years, when the Henning Hammarlund founded his company in Sv&auml;ngsta
  as the first watch factory in northern Europe. Henning who was considered a mechanical genius, had attended the Geneva
  Academy of Horology in Switzerland, which is the most prominent watch making school in the world. In other words, he
  knew a thing or two about watches.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Porsche, Lamborghini and Bugatti</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The price of a Halda Pocket watch was around seven monthly salaries. However, during the First World War, demand for
  pocket watches decreased so much that the factory had to stop producing watches. Nevertheless, this didn&rsquo;t stop
  Halda from pursuing fine mechanical advances in other fields.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Halda ramified with several companies and products, including the fishing reel manufacturer ABU Garcia, and the Speed
  Pilot which was one of the first professional instrument for motorsport. The company behind Speed Pilot is currently
  called Haldex and has grown fairly big in the world of motorsport, supplying gearboxes and four-wheel drive to many of
  the luxury car manufacturers such as Porsche, Lamborghini and Bugatti.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Red Dot Design Award</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In 2006, Swedish engineer and entrepreneur Mikael Sandstr&ouml;m decided to revive the Halda Watch Company.&nbsp;Mr.
  Sandstr&ouml;m had been working with watch development for over two decades and shared the vision of Henning Hammarlund
  in refusing to compromise on quality and innovation. The brand was relaunched with the unveiling of a new watch intended
  for space travel: the Halda Space Discovery. The watch was developed in collaboration with Nasa/ESA astronaut Christer
  Fuglesang, who also tested it during his second mission into space in 2009.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Upon today, Halda Space Discovery is used as an instrument by most of the European astronauts on their missions at
  the ISS space station and the watch has been awarded with the Red Dot Design Award. Halda exclusively produce around 300
  timepieces a year and they are all carefully assembled by hand in the facility just outside Stockholm. The company seeks
  to manufacture as much parts themselves as possible and even make the digital technology in-house.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>According to FIA regulations</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In 2014 Halda unveiled yet another creation &ndash; the Race Pilot. This watch was developed together with racing
  drivers &ndash; one of them was the Swedish Formula 1 driver Marcus Ericsson. The intension is to assist professional
  racing drivers and their teams who work under extreme time pressure. Among the functions is the ability to measure speed
  and lap times &ndash; everything according to FIA regulations. We find a G-force meter that shows the extreme forces
  you&rsquo;re subjected to during acceleration, braking and turns. The watch also comes with information about 150 racing
  circuits around the world, including their length, record laps and height above sea level. It all comes in an elegant
  package and a very user-friendly interface.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>2014 the Halda Race Pilot was announced as the winner of the prestigious price The European Watch of the Year. Just
  like the Space Discovery, the Race Pilot has a docking station to which you can easily fit different watch modules. Once
  the day at the track is over and you want to change from a racing suit to a blazer, you can easily switch the racing
  module for an elegant, mechanical module.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Made of 18K gold</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The movement of the mechanical module is produced by the renowned manufacture Zenith who also supplied the Rolex
  Daytona with its movements. The stunning movement, which has a 50-hour power reserve, is visible through the crystal
  case back.&nbsp;The latest addition to the Halda family is the Race Pilot Gold. Its platform is made of 18K gold and the
  dial is made from 20 individually manufactured pieces carefully applied on a base of carbon fiber. The Race Pilot Gold
  features a self-winding movement from ZENITH with date, sub-second and power reserve indicator. The 45mm case is
  processed out of titanium and finished with a black DLC coating. It is built to withstand a pressure equivalent to 10
  ATM (100 meters).</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Race Pilot Gold is also available with the Trackmaster &ndash; a military grade GPS unit for track racing. When
  placed on the inside of the windscreen, it communicates wirelessly with a digital watch module. The Trackmaster
  automatically locates the racetrack with all its individualities and during racing it measures with a frequency of 10
  times per second and an accuracy down to 1/100 of a second. The unit has an integrated 6-axis accelerometer measuring
  maximum G-forces. During a race, the Trackmaster shows the predictive lap timing in real time; how the driver is
  performing against the best lap. In other words, the Trackmaster gives the driver instant feedback with the help of a
  series of red and green light indicators.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/automotive/halda-speed-through-time</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/automotive/halda-speed-through-time</guid><category><![CDATA[Automotive]]></category><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 17:31:12 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>James Holm</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Reinvention of Publishing]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>The publishing industry is in pain, but still, the magazine publishers seem intent on digging their own grave, doing
  too little too late.</p>

  <p><strong>Elvis has left the building.</strong></p>

  <p>Remember in the early 2000s, we all got our first MP3-players and a year later we bought our new shiny iPod&rsquo;s
  (with a design to die for).</p>

  <p>The natural next step would have been for the music industry to wake up and deliver their music to us, right?
  Unfortunately, Elvis had left the building.</p>

  <p>We were law-abiding citizens but frustrated that the record labels wouldn&rsquo;t deliver this basic service to us,
  we downloaded from file sharing sites. Apple being forward-thinking, addressed this with iTunes, but you still needed an
  iPod and it was way too expensive to pay 99 cents per song.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>If you would have asked me in the early 2000s if I would ever pay for music again, I would have laughed in your
  face.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Not until a small company called Spotify came along, did anyone have (literally anyone) a realistic long-term view on
  consumer behavior for recorded music and how to charge for its services.</p>

  <p>If you would have asked me in the early 2000s if I would ever pay for music again, I would have laughed in your face.
  And look at me now, happily paying 15 USD for a family subscription. I have never spent so much on music and never going
  back to file-sharing again.</p>

  <p>What changed? For me, the convenience of the Spotify service trumps free content, every day of the month.</p>

  <p>The magazine market is currently 4x the recorded music market, and with experiences from the music and book
  industries, it would be logical to think that a lot is happening at the publishers, right? Publishers and their top
  executives working day &amp; night since the millennia developing, testing and launching an array of next generation of
  &ldquo;magazine products&rdquo;. Think again. Elvis has definitely left the building.</p>

  <p><strong>Why are the publishers unable to change?</strong></p>

  <p>There are thousands of articles on the subject and the most common denominator between them spells culture. Whereas
  some publishers have managed to adjust their view on what is needed to survive, most magazine publishers are right now
  having a &ldquo;Titanic moment&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>When the inevitable(?) recession hits, the publishers will literally be jumping into the cold North Atlantic in their
  life vests, and with very few lifeboats within sight.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Providing a few click-bait articles on your website or distributing PDF: ed magazines isn&rsquo;t a life vest, much
  less a lifeboat.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Until recently, digital was the ugly stepchild in which the publishers have consistently under-invested in the last
  20 years. And no, providing a few click-bait articles on your website or distributing PDF:ed magazines through services
  like Zinio, Magzter or Readly isn&rsquo;t a life vest, much less a lifeboat.</p>

  <p>So is it all lost? Will there be any survivors? Of course, but the few magazine publishers surviving this ordeal will
  be scarred for life and probably more appreciative of the idea that their publishing house wasn&rsquo;t unsinkable.</p>

  <p>Look at the book publishing industry in the US. Long dominated by a handful of big publishing houses (Big Five)
  telling us consumers what to read. The 2008 recession and Amazon created the &ldquo;perfect storm&rdquo; leading to
  massive layoffs. Did it change the direction or how the Big Five did their business? Not really, they managed to cling
  onto their life vests (i.e. a few big-name authors), while watching their market share plummet.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>The growth of new indie book publishers is explosive but is still largely invisible.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The growth of new indie book publishers is explosive but is still largely invisible. A lot of new up &amp; coming
  authors can make middle-class incomes as their own publishers, many joining forces to create virtual publishing houses.
  Publishing-as-a-Service business models (e.g. Reedsy.com), offers some of the best editorial, production, and marketing
  talent.</p>

  <p>Today, self-publishing accounts for about 30&lt;40 percent of the eBook market while small- to medium-sized
  publishers account for another 20 percent. Authors no longer need the publishing houses&#39; expertise because they can
  utilize the data and e-commerce solutions provided by web services like Amazon.</p>

  <p>Also in the music industry, we are seeing an&nbsp;upward trend&nbsp;where artists are bypassing the record labels
  (using services like Distrokid.com) and going independent keeping the rights to their music, their creative freedom and
  a much larger piece of the pie.</p>

  <p><strong>So how will the future of magazine publishing look?</strong></p>

  <p>Well for sure, platforms will, slowly but surely, continue to eat market share from the big publishing houses, all
  busy consolidating and cutting costs &mdash; because that is what big businesses do when they don&rsquo;t have a clue.
  Most of the small to medium-sized publishers will perish, as they don&rsquo;t have the scale, resources or in-house
  expertise to survive in a world with decreasing CPM&rsquo;s, data-driven publishing and AI.</p>

  <p>Why platforms? Because virtually everything that the publishers are doing today, can either be automated or done more
  efficiently on a platform. Key publishing activities like sourcing &amp; compensating creatives and creating, editing,
  packaging, distributing &amp; monetizing content can all be streamlined while utilizing AI/ML.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Virtually everything that the publishers are doing today, can either be automated or done more efficiently on a
  platform.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We agree with Ev Williams when he&nbsp;says&nbsp;there won&rsquo;t be a Spotify of publishing and share his belief
  that there will be a number of global platforms that cater to different consumer needs and styles. How many? Who knows.
  A few will be run by the big publishing houses, and a few will be run by companies like Medium and Enliven.</p>

  <p>No doubt most of these &ldquo;premium&rdquo; editorial platforms will be partially or fully monetized by subscription
  models (or possibly micropayments). And as seen in Medium and Netflix, there is a discerning audience still willing to
  pay for premium content and to get rid of &ldquo;in-your-face&rdquo; direct or indirect advertising.</p>

  <p>Well, how about Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple? They are, of course, part of this equation, but producing news
  and magazine editorial content probably isn&rsquo;t on the top of their list. Content production is messy and the
  Netflix experiment of quickly producing a lot of content might show to be a flawed and costly strategy. GAFA seems more
  intent on building subscription bundles owning the consumer and their user data.</p>

  <p>The big winners, apart from the consumers, will be talented creatives that will connect, monetize and interact with
  their audience.</p>

  <p>So what you need to succeed in the future magazine market? Well, we believe there are a few key points;</p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Well-designed</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; For too long, the design of web publishing started and ended with
  display advertising &mdash; UX friendly we think not. It is time to overhaul the basic assumptions on how an editorial
  UX should look.</li>

  <li><strong>Personalized</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; With the abundance of content, attention deficit and our general lack of
  time, personalization is no longer a &ldquo;Nice to Have&rdquo; for any publisher, it is a &ldquo;Must Have&rdquo;. Here
  a lot will happen in the coming years in terms of algorithmic development and new products &amp; services.</li>

  <li><strong>Enough Premium Content </strong>and Creatives&nbsp;&mdash; enough to meet your user&rsquo;s demand, but not
  too much to disappoint your creatives.</li>

  <li>Reasonable Price Point&nbsp;&mdash; The risk of subscription fatigue and fierce competition from user-generated
  content, a modern magazine product needs to have a relevant price point.</li>

  <li><strong>Creator&nbsp;Friendly&nbsp;</strong>&mdash; Its a talent business and to attract the best talent you need to
  offer a great product with clear tangible and intangible benefits to the creative. Examples could include competitive
  revenue share, retaining full copyrights, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A lean editorial process&nbsp;&mdash; You would be surprised in finding out how tedious, inefficient and
  non-collaborative current editorial processes look. This artisanal way of working will radically change with the
  introduction of a more networked approach, AI and better publishing tools.</p>

  <p>We bet that the big winners, apart from the consumers, will be talented creatives that will have better chances of
  connecting, monetizing and interacting with their audience. Will all creatives become winners, of course not, but with
  editorial platforms, more creatives have a chance to find their audience. Who needs a publisher in this day and age,
  especially when they leave you with peanuts, a small byline, and no creative freedom?</p>

  <p>words: Kiša Lala</p>
  <p>Photography</p>

  <p>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Most civilizations begin around watering holes - at the nexus of rivers and lakes around which tellurians thrive.
  When nomads pitched their tents in deserts, it was near an oasis, a natural source of groundwater. In Jordan, the
  ancient city of Petra grew from a desert rest-stop for traders to a cosmopolitan hub through harnessing precious
  rainwater and channeling it through an array of strategic plumbing. In the desert, a drop of water can tip the scale
  between life and death.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The city of Jodhpur in the western state of Rajasthan in India, grew out of a cluster of settlements in the arid
  landscape of the Thar desert, ruled by the Rajputs, a union of mounted warrior clans, and a chieftain of the Rathore
  clan, prince Jodha in 1459, built a fortress, Mehrangarh, on a nearby rocky outcrop.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The original stones of that walled citadel are embedded now within the modern city, which has expanded to house
  millions. Currently, the honorific Maharaja of Jodhpur has inherited the now much-enlarged fort and city palace. With
  that mantle of ownership came the responsibility for its upkeep, and he astutely transitioned his reign from the feudal
  role of his ancestors to the preservation of the city&rsquo;s heritage, monetizing and modernizing public access to the
  fort and palace grounds.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>At the foot of the Mehrangarh fort within the medieval walled city lies the Raas hotel, owned by brothers Dhananjay
  and Nikhilendra Singh, related to the original Rathore clan. They pride themselves in departing from the aesthetics of
  old-school showy opulence characteristic of the city&rsquo;s palace accommodations, instead&nbsp;creating a calm oasis
  sanctuary with modern minimalist tones.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The tall entranceway leads through a narrow passage to a stunning view of the fort at the mountain&rsquo;s pinnacle,
  and the surrounding lodgings are built around a courtyard pool. Adjacent to the hotel grounds, and as an almost ancient
  parallel to the hotel&rsquo;s leisure pool, is an 18th c. stepwell named &lsquo;Toor Ji Ka Jhalra&rsquo;. The stepwell
  is a quadrangular excavated walled well with steps leading down to the water level, used in olden times as a reservoir,
  and place of respite.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The construction of stepwells have been documented in India from as early as 2650 BCE at Dholavira in the Indus
  Valley, where an enormous stone-cut well with steps had been found to collect and drain water into storage tanks. Even
  with extreme summer temperatures in Rajasthan, the brief monsoon rains in ancient times fetched enough rainfall to
  sustain a population of thousands. Jodhpur today, along with the millions of inhabitants of the Thar desert, have the
  use of modern technologies to supply them with water, but using costly resources, and with permanent drainage of
  India&rsquo;s dwindling aquifers. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>There are many such stone-cut stepwells built without mortar, throughout India, some had been used by royal women for
  leisure, embellished with elegant architectural details, and carved subterranean passageways, aligned in geometric
  patterns that appear anachronistically modern. And yet in the 21st century, because of the availability of alternate
  sources of water, these wells were neglected, often used as garbage dumps. A second stepwell the &ldquo;Mahila Bagh ki
  Jhalra&rdquo; also lay abandoned in the vicinity of the hotel.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To support the brother&rsquo;s vision of reclaiming these sites, Dhanajay partnered with JDH, which was founded as an
  investment group to restore these heritage sites within the old walled city. They drained the stagnating pool filled
  with debris, and sandblasted the walls. The sandstone quarried around Jodhpur had been used for centuries, being tough
  and resistant to abrasion with its distinctive rose, red and buff tones found in the Mehrangarh fort. In the process of
  revitalizing the old sites many local craftsmen were employed, keeping alive the lineage of artisans skilled in ancient
  techniques of stone carving.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Raas uses traditional stone screens as an exterior layer over some of their rooms - often hand-carved, these
  perforated stone or&nbsp;latticed&nbsp;screen, called &ldquo;Jali&rdquo; help to lower the temperature by diffusing the
  breeze&nbsp;through the holes, and also create additional shade. These traditional transparent screens were discarded in
  favour of more privacy in modern times.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The passage of the sun and the play of light and shade, are an important element of desert architecture. The high
  walls of the stepwell create deep shade over the pool leaving the water below refreshingly cool. A pool in a central
  courtyard, also creates a cooling effect with evaporating water, the cooled air disperses through the surrounding
  structures creating natural air-conditioning. In Mehrangarh fort, the open architecture built along a series of
  interlocking pavilions, allow cool breezes to pass through unobstructed, with walls positioned to create cooling shadows
  even in the hottest hours of the day.</p>

  <p>The excavations and cleaning at the stepwell also exposed details of the carvings of animals and deities on the
  walls, and the oxygenated water in the well now supports fish-life, and in the afternoons children now come to play in
  the plunge pool. JDH&rsquo;s renovations also extended to the nearby havelis, the traditional townhouses, and continues
  today with the mission of adding cafes and food markets to create a commercial hub with an emphasis on a green circular
  economy.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/architecture/jodhpur-desert-architecture-and-stepwell</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/architecture/jodhpur-desert-architecture-and-stepwell</guid><category><![CDATA[Architecture]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:22:57 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Danica O.

Also, one of my favourite recipes; it’s
  based on probably the only cake my mother ever made. I don’t bake often for myself or friends, but if I do in the autumn
  and winter, it’s usually this. </p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.&rdquo;&nbsp;―&nbsp;James
  Baldwin,&nbsp;Giovanni&rsquo;s Room</p>

  <p>After spending two weeks in Athens for the Christmas holidays, after a few irresistibly sunny, yet very cold days
  which were all at once&nbsp;clamorous and intimately tranquil, nonchalant and deeply moving, I returned to&nbsp;London.
  Back to this&nbsp;mad beehive, back to&nbsp;my usual ways. I come bearing the signs of parents growing older and wiser
  and further away, the memories of the perfectly blinding sun and the remains of time passing by both slowly and
  unbearably fast. I&#39;ve returned home from home and there&#39;s so much to be inspired by and think about, not least
  what is home.</p>

  <p>Much like for a lot of people, home for me can be explained, outlined and expressed through food: flavours, textures
  and ingredients, all can allude to a familiarity which contains both joy and a subtle sense of melancholia. Home can be
  a dish that, once you see it, smell it and, most of all, taste it, brings back memories, or merely the echo of a memory,
  a sensation that often cannot be expressed but feels like recognising something that&rsquo;s always been inside us and
  won&rsquo;t leave (or we won&rsquo;t let go of it), regardless of time passing. Each dish perfectly encapsulating both
  comfort and nostalgia (nostos, &ldquo;&nu;ό&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;&rdquo;, very appropriately signifying the
  longing for home in Greek).</p>

  <p>When I&rsquo;m in London, I don&rsquo;t long for my mother&rsquo;s food- I simply long for her. When I&rsquo;m back
  in Athens though, the first plate of food I taste (which I make sure is homemade, always) is bittersweet: it seems like
  with every bite, I can suddenly but surely count the moments, days, years I&rsquo;ve been away. I feel the distance and
  proximity all at once, I feel at home and not at all as well. Each bite is both delicious (my mother is an excellent
  cook) and satisfying as only a homemade dish can be, yet fills me with an undertone of sadness, as I know all too well
  (not so much in my mind, possibly not even when I taste the food, but somewhere deeper, as if my body knows, knows
  better than my mind) that they signify something I left back a while ago. Still, they remain all too familiar, very much
  a part of me, therefore home.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>So, driven by flavours, smells, textures, I&rsquo;ve found over the years many flavours that spell out home for me.
  In the winter, it&rsquo;s most often apples: in Greece some are too big for one person to eat alone, thick skinned and
  crimson pink, kind of bready in texture. In London, they come in endless varieties and I usually prefer small ones,
  which are a little tart yet still sweet and&nbsp; crispier than the ones I grew up eating.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>So now, here, in another country, another city, I&rsquo;ve made another home from bits and pieces from both homes.
  I&rsquo;ve found a home in dishes both known by heart and foreign to what my mother makes. They are both very dear and
  deeply comforting, so I go back to them time and time again, tasting with each bite more recent memories, remembering
  with each mouthful places and people and moments that gifted me this new home.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I can&rsquo;t escape the in-betweeness, I can&rsquo;t choose, nor do I want to. I&rsquo;ve made peace with having one
  foot here and one there, with a heart and mind that face two (often time opposite) directions, yet feeling not divided
  but rather becoming richer for it. Home is exactly right there for me, in accepting what I can&rsquo;t deny, in finding
  it in the little things, the ones I feel with all the senses. And sometimes, when I&rsquo;m in doubt, I go into the
  kitchen. And there, wherever I am, I find a welcome home always.</p>

  <p>Brown butter &amp; hazelnut apple cake</p>

  <p>* This is one of my favourite recipes; it&rsquo;s based on probably the only cake my mother ever made. I don&rsquo;t
  bake often for myself or friends, but if I do in the autumn and winter, it&rsquo;s usually this.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>125 gr unsalted butter, browned&nbsp;</p>

  <p>150g demerara sugar</p>

  <p>3 medium eggs</p>

  <p>zest from 1 lemon</p>

  <p>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract ,</p>

  <p>250g plain flour</p>

  <p>2 tsp baking powder</p>

  <p>1/2 tsp salt</p>

  <p>1 tsp all spice</p>

  <p>1 tsp ground cinnamon</p>

  <p>50g hazelnuts, toasted &amp; roughly chopped</p>

  <p>3/4 c almond milk&nbsp;</p>

  <p>3 large apples, washed, cored and thinly sliced</p>

  <p>to serve:</p>

  <p>2 tablespoons honey, warmed over low heat until runny and/ or icing sugar and ground cinnamon</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>

  <p>Preheat the oven to 180&ordm;C (160&ordm;C FAN), grease a cake pan (both bottom &amp; sides) and line it with
  parchment paper .</p>

  <p>Place the butter in a small sauce pan, melt over medium heat and continue cooking until lightly browned and smelling
  nutty, swirling the pan from time to time. It will take about 8&rsquo;, but keep a close eye (and nose) on it, as it can
  burn easily. Once ready, remove from the pan, pour into a small bowl and allow it to cool.</p>

  <p>Beat the cool butter &amp; sugar and add the eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition, until fluffy.
  Add the lemon zest and vanilla extract and combine.</p>

  <p>Combine flour, baking powder, spices &amp; salt and add to the wet mixture.</p>

  <p>Lastly add the hazelnuts and milk and mix well with a spatula.</p>

  <p>Pour the batter into the cake pan and arrange the apple slices on top.</p>

  <p>Bake in the preheated oven for about 40&rsquo; or until an inserted skewer comes our clean.</p>

  <p>Allow to cool for 15&rsquo;, then remove from the tin and place on a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

  <p>Brush with warm honey and/ or icing sugar &amp; cinnamon.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/home-and-my-mothers-brown-butter-hazelnut-apple-cake</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/home-and-my-mothers-brown-butter-hazelnut-apple-cake</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 19:30:27 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Amaryllis Tsegou</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mum's special Roasted Red Onions]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Almost good enough to eat on their own, this simple but stylish recipe turns roasted onions into a real treat</p>

  <p>Mum&#39;s special roast red onions</p>

  <p>Roasted onions are delicious in any form but this recipe makes them positively stylish.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will become
  soft, sweet and gooey with just a tiny kick from the mustard.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could almost eat them with simply a chunk
  of warm crusty bread!&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&#39;s so easy - you don&#39;t even need to peel them!</p>

  <p>8 medium sized onions (or allow 2 per person), cleaned and trimmed of roots but not peeled<br />
  brown sugar<br />
  English made mustard, (or French according to taste)</p>

  <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the onions root end down in a small roasting tin.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may need to trim them to make
  sure they sit flat but do not cut into the base.<br />
  2.&nbsp; From the top, partly peel back but do not remove, the outer layers of skin.<br />
  3.&nbsp;&nbsp; With a sharp knife cut out a small hollow in the flesh of the onion big enough to hold 1 teaspoon of
  mustard and a teaspoon of brown sugar, filling each one as you go, mustard first, sugar on top.<br />
  4.&nbsp; Tuck the layers of skin back over.<br />
  5.&nbsp; If cooking on their own pop into the centre of a pre-heated medium hot oven - 375 degrees F/190C/Gas Mk 5 - for
  25 minutes then turn up the heat to 400 degrees F/200C Gas Mk 6 for 15-20 until completely tender, caramelising and
  probably beginning to bubble over!&nbsp;&nbsp; Or roast for similar time alongside your main dish. &nbsp;<br />
  6.&nbsp; Serve as they are so everyone can peel off the outer skins to discover the delicacy hiding within!</p>

  <p>Picture shows the recipe with onions halved - another option which cooks quicker but is slightly less exciting!</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/mums-special-roasted-red-onions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/mums-special-roasted-red-onions</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 15:52:03 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Sue Atkinson</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[INSOMNIA ]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>After hours moody fashion editorial inspired by the state of Insomnia. </p>

  <p>Matcha was the first form of powdered tea and was introduced to Japan from China by a Zen monk named Eisai in 1191,
  who brought tea seeds and Zen scriptures. The matcha helped the monks stay awake during their long sessions of
  meditation. This evolved into being to be taken as herbal medicine and developed as a tea ceremony&nbsp;called
  &ldquo;Sadou&rdquo; in Japan with the Zen Buddhism philosophy.&nbsp; I will explain about this in my next article.</p>

  <p>These days matcha is gaining attention as a super food in the world and it is recognised as an iconic flavour in
  Japanese sweets and Western confectionery in caf&eacute; culture and organic grocery stores.</p>

  <p>Sometimes people confuse match and green tea.&nbsp; So, what is the difference between matcha and green tea?<br />
  Confusingly, matcha means powdered tea.&nbsp; Green tea can also be a powder, but leaf from green tea is more
  common.&nbsp; Green tea has a fresh aroma, while matcha has a unique sweet scent. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>These teas are different kinds of tea and have different cultivation and processing methods.&nbsp;&nbsp; Matcha is
  made by powdering Tencha.&nbsp; The cultivation method of Tencha is different from other tea plants.&nbsp; Whereas
  ordinary tea plants grow in plenty of sunlight,&nbsp;Tencha is grown with covering so that it&rsquo;s not exposed to
  sunlight for so long.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the Tencha leaves increase in chlorophyll and become a stronger green
  colour.&nbsp;&nbsp; They also grow richer in theanine, which is the umami component of matcha, well known for its
  relaxing effect.</p>

  <p>Green tea is Sencha and a few other tea leaves.&nbsp; Sencha grows without the need for covering.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
  contains more catechin which has the effect of preventing an increase in cholesterol and blood sugar but makes the green
  tea taste bitter compared to matcha.&nbsp;&nbsp; Matcha is also rich in vitamins, minerals, catechin, and insoluble
  dietary fibre which assist anti-ageing, adjust immunity, beauty effect, measures for controlling body fat etc..</p>

  <p>Matcha Mochi Recipe</p>

  <p>Ingredients - to make 8</p>

  <p>40 g&nbsp; rice flour<br />
  40 g&nbsp; sweet rice flour<br />
  90 ml water<br />
  150g&nbsp; white bean paste *<br />
  1 tbsp&nbsp; green tea powder<br />
  8 raspberries</p>

  <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;for white bean paste (makes 300g)<br />
  200g&nbsp; dried white kidney beans (or other white beans)<br />
  600ml water for cooking the beans (3 times the quantity of beans)<br />
  100g&nbsp; sugar (half the quantity of beans)<br />
  A pinch of salt<br />
  1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (optional)</p>

  <p>Directions<br />
  To make white bean paste</p>

  <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash the dried beans and put them in plenty of water in a large saucepan overnight (around 8 hours and
  more in winter).<br />
  2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next day, add the bicarbonate of soda to the pan and boil the water with beans for 5 minutes.&nbsp; While
  boiling, skim off the scum.&nbsp; &rdquo;Skim the scum &ldquo;is an important skill in Japanese cooking as leaving the
  scum affects the taste of the food<br />
  3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Strain the beans and rinse in cold water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove the skins by rubbing them or peeling them
  off by hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is important in order to make the paste smooth.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bicarbonate of soda
  softens the skin of beans to make this process easier.<br />
  4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the beans and 600ml water in a pressure cooker if you have one. When the pressure kicks in, simmer
  for 20 minutes on low heat.&nbsp; Then turn the heat off and allow to cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; If using a normal pan, cook for
  1 hour, topping up the water as necessary.<br />
  5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Strain and transfer the beans to a food processor and blend to make a smooth paste.<br />
  6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the paste, sugar and salt back into a clean saucepan and heat to thicken, stirring with a wooden
  spoon over the flame. Remove from the heat when the mixture begins to thicken like a jam.&nbsp; This should take
  approximately 15 minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&rsquo;s important to bear in mind that the paste will harden as it cools and
  you are going to make it into balls later. &nbsp;<br />
  7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blend in the matcha powder using a spatula.<br />
  8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the paste into a clean container and cover with cling film. Don&rsquo;t keep it in the cooking pan or
  it will become harder and dry out.</p>

  <p>This paste can be kept in the fridge for 2-3 days and in the freezer for 3 months.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To make Green Tea Mochi</p>

  <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Divide the green tea paste into 8 and wrap a raspberry to make 8 balls.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set aside.&nbsp;
  &nbsp;<br />
  2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put both flours and water in a heatproof bowl. Mix them and cover with cling film.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put in a
  medium powered&nbsp; (600W) microwave for 30 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove and stir with a spatula.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Cover again and put it back in the microwave for another 30 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should start to become
  transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, repeat the process until it is.&nbsp;&nbsp; When cool enough to handle, remove
  the&nbsp; mochi mixture and place on a floured tray or table.<br />
  3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Divide into 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stretch each piece into a circle with the fingers. Wrap each of the matcha
  balls with mochi dough.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
  4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Serve with your favourite tea.</p>

  move to Bali with his wife and set up a restaurant. </p>

  <p>This native Canadian is one of the most influential chefs in Indonesia today, and he is running one of the best
  restaurants! He graduated with a Degree in Culinary Arts back home in Canada. Kevin has worked at some amazing places
  like the three-star restaurants Arzak and El Bulli in Spain, the two-star restaurant La Broche in Madrid, three-star
  restaurant Daniel in New York City, Shangri-La in both Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.</p>

  <p>Kevin opened up restaurant Cuca in Jimbaran, Bali in 2013 and since then he has attracted guests from all over the
  world. When I first met Kevin I was covering Gastronomika in San Sebasti&aacute;n, Spain. Kevin was the most charismatic
  chef up there at the stage, people could really feel and taste what he was talking about.</p>

  <p>I understand why people all over the world wants him to come and speak about his passion, food! So when visiting Bali
  I had a trip to his restaurant Cuca at my program and asked Kevin some questions. (And you will find out more about the
  restaurant in another post!) I had a chat with Kevin before the meal:</p>

  <p><strong>What type of restaurant is Cuca?</strong></p>

  <p>- We have a lot of functions and events here, actually, we have something nearly every day! We have a lounge area
  were 50-100 people can come and chill, have a drink, and eat. You can also choose to sit outside or inside, in the bar
  area, in our private dining area or by the kitchen where you can watch the chefs. We are open 7 days a week from 12 to
  12. It is a part of my wife&rsquo;s business philosophy that we always should be available for people who want to visit
  us.</p>

  <p><strong>Tell us about who is working at the restaurant??</strong></p>

  <p>- There are 127 people working at Cuca. And when they start they have no English, no hospitality we train everyone
  from zero. They get to rotate at various stations at the restaurant. Not even the people in the bar has worked in a bar
  before, and the same with everyone in the kitchen. We train them from zero and the results for us have been fantastic!
  Lots of people, but a lot of work.</p>

  <p><strong>Do you import anything from other countries?</strong></p>

  <p>- Everything we serve is from Indonesia and everything we serve we make from scratch.</p>

  <p><strong>Is there a difference in the customers over the seasons?</strong></p>

  <p>- We have our peak season June to October, where June and October are relatively soft in comparison. But everything
  else within those dates is very busy. And then we have December that is busy too.</p>

  <p><strong>So do you have Balinese customers?</strong></p>

  <p>- We have zero customers from Bali, but they do come from all over Indonesia, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Europe,
  Australia, America&hellip;</p>

  <p><strong>Can you describe your style of food?</strong></p>

  <p>- I want to create food people won&rsquo;t forget, things that when you eat you always remember it. We try very hard
  to create something memorable. We serve no traditional food in the restaurant. Many westerners think that we serve very
  Indonesian food, and the Indonesian customers think that we serve very western food.</p>

  <p><strong>So when you set a menu do you set it out of what you can get hold off?</strong></p>

  <p>- It is a combination, we start with a dish that we love. We go to a country and eats something. Like smoked fish in
  Scandinavia and then we think about why we love that dish so much. And then we try to invert it in Cuca using local
  ingredients.</p>

  <p><strong>Do you want to open up in more places.</strong></p>

  <p>- No there is only one Cuca! I want to do one thing as good as I can, if I had any more businesses then they would
  require 50% of my time. And I don&rsquo;t know how I could do something amazing when I only had 50%. For me that would
  be very difficult, I know other people manage. But I see the little things every day, and if I am not here who would fix
  it? The customers would probably not notice, but I would.</p>

  <p><strong>Are you planning to stay in Bali?</strong></p>

  <p>- Yes, forever! (Lucky him)</p>

  properties</p>

  <p>Lovage is an incredibly tasty herb resembling a cross between celery and parsley with a hint of aniseed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  It is a tall perennial plant, easily reaching well over a metre in height with splendid flowering heads. &nbsp; All
  parts of the plant can be used in a variety of ways - the leaves as a herb, the roots as a vegetable and the seeds as a
  spice.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also has medicinal properties, being applied to the treatment of urinary and kidney
  conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; While not difficult to grow in average soil in sun or part shade, it is seldom seen for sale in
  food shops although young plants are quite often available from garden centres.</p>

  <p>I was first introduced to lovage by broadcaster and writer Judith Hann when I photographed recipes for her book
  &#39;The Food of Love&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I tasted her recipe for Guinea fowl with lime and lovage I was hooked and
  have been growing lovage in my own garden ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my adaptation, best made with young stems in
  the spring.</p>

  <p>Lovage and chicken soup (for 2)</p>

  <p>1 large corn-fed chicken thigh, skin on<br />
  1 medium onion, chopped<br />
  1 clove garlic, finely chopped<br />
  1 tbsp olive oil (optional)<br />
  3 stems lovage, approx 30 cms length or equivalent (the younger, the better), leaves separated and chopped roughly,
  keeping 2 sprigs for garnish, stems cut into lengths to fit the base of your pan (you will need to remove them later)<br
  />
  11/2&nbsp;pints chicken stock<br />
  2 tbsp dry white wine<br />
  4 tbsp fromage frais/ Greek yogurt<br />
  juice of 1/2 lime<br />
  salt and pepper to season</p>

  <p>1 In a heavy-bottomed pan, dry-fry the chicken skin-side down to release the fat and brown skin. Cook until it no
  longer sticks to the pan.<br />
  2 Remove from pan, cool, remove bone and chop flesh, removing skin if preferred and any excess fat.<br />
  3 Gently fry chopped onion in fat from chicken for 2 minutes.<br />
  4 Adding olive oil if necessary, fry garlic with onion for a further 1/2 minute or until garlic just begins to
  colour.<br />
  5 Spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of the pan and add lovage stems and leaves.<br />
  6 Place chicken on top of lovage.<br />
  7 Pour in stock and wine to cover chicken.&nbsp; Bring to boil.<br />
  8 Cover and reduce heat to simmer for 35 minutes to allow the flavours to really combine.<br />
  9 Remove from heat and carefully remove lovage stems which tend to be very tough even when cooked.<br />
  10 Add fromage frais or yogurt and lime juice.<br />
  11 Return to simmer and stir until well mixed. Season to taste.<br />
  12 Serve immediately garnished with remaining sprigs of leaves.</p>

  model is perfect for you.</p>

  <p>Some are of the opinion that Lamborghini has lost his soul and stopped building super sports cars in the spirit of
  the devilish bull they used to do. They are wrong.</p>

  <p>In the past, these&nbsp;cars were extremely brutal. Allowing a mother-in-law sit behind the wheel of a Countach or
  Diablo was unthinkable. These older models required a firm handle and even an experienced&nbsp;driver had&nbsp;a hard
  time with cars of this generation. They are simply too difficult to drive.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Allowing a mother-in-law behind the wheel of a Countach or Diablo was unthinkable.&nbsp; They are simply too
  difficult to drive</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When Audi took over the helm and started pumping money into the Italian company in 2003, a lot started happening.
  From standing on the verge of the ruin, the company began to show positive figures. The first model with Audi&#39;s
  technology was Gallardo. It sold a total of 14,000 cars during its lifetime and became a mega success. Even the
  successor Hurac&aacute;n became a success and has sold incredibly well. Together, these models belong to a completely
  new type of Lamborghini cars with modern German technology under the shell. Here you can easily let an inexperienced
  driver enjoy the driving experience, albeit with a bit of frightening delight.</p>

  <p>Parallel to the&nbsp;Gallardo, the larger Murcielago was prepped for production. Unlike Gallardo with its German-made
  V10, Murcielago had Lamborghini&#39;s own V12 engine. An engine that has lived for decades and originated as far back in
  time as Miura which was launched in 1966.</p>

  <p>Murcielago was largely developed before Audi came into the picture. Although it received some technology from the
  Germans, it was large, unwieldy, and, in comparison with Gallardo, difficult for the inexperienced driver. The brutal
  bull was still alive in Murcielago!</p>

  <p>In 2011, Murcielago was replaced with Aventador. Since then, Aventador has come in a variety of designs. Like both
  Diablo and Murcielago, Aventador is also available in an SV variant. SV stands for &ldquo;Super Veloce&rdquo; which is
  Italian for Super Speed. The recipe for the SV models is about lower weight and more horsepower. Aventador SV has 50
  extra horses compared to the original.</p>

  <p>In addition to the race for most horsepower,&nbsp;there is also another record that is the holy grail.. We speak of
  course about the fastest time around N&uuml;rburgring in Germany. To accomplish this, a car that is at all needs a
  purely racing car. Porsche has been at the top of the throne many times. In addition, Porsche has the absolute fastest
  time ever with its custom-built model 919 EVO which is 5: 19.546.</p>

  <p>But Lamborghini has also set a record number of times. To show the world that even a strong Italian bull can be the
  fastest around the ring, Aventador SV was built with the addition J which stands for &quot;Jota&quot;. Aventador SVJ
  thus stands for &ldquo;Super Veloce Jota&rdquo;. In July 2018, a new record time was set with Aventador SVJ at 6: 44.97,
  thus taking the pallet location from Porsche and their 911 GT2 RS.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>My relationship with Lamborghini goes far back in time</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>My relationship with Lamborghini goes far back in time. In the eighties and nineties I was with my father Bengt Holm
  at the factory several times. The reason then was a large car book project he worked on called the Cars Collection. When
  I later chose to follow in his footsteps, it was obviously a door opener to bring books from the time with my father to
  show off. This has meant a lot to me and the factory has always been very generous with lending cars for test drives.
  But when I was told by Sant&#39;Agata Bolognese that an Aventador SVJ was at my disposal for a few days, I hardly
  thought it was true.<br />
  &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Aventador SVJ is even lighter, even stronger and even harder than Aventador SV. It is a street legal track-ready
  super sports car with an uncharged V12 engine of 770 horses. There is hardly any sound insulation at all between you and
  the engine behind your back. Add to that Lamborghini&#39;s intelligent aerodynamic system ALA (Aerodinamica Lamborghini
  Attiva) that SVJ is first with. The system means 40 percent more downforce than Aventador SV. In short, the Aventador
  SVJ is built to go crazy fast while staying glued to the road as it turns.</p>

  <p>To experience this unique Lamborghini, I chose a destination I had driven before: Cortina d&#39;Ampezzo and over
  Passo Giau. The road is incredibly good and challenging. You can really feel about the car&#39;s performance and road
  holding. Aventador SVJ is not very comfortable. It shouldn&#39;t be either. You sit like a screwdriver in the
  Alcantara-clad shell chairs. Instead of floor mats, the bare metal floor with grip tape is the type you have on
  skateboards so as not to slip. For weight reasons, the carbon fiber-clad doors have no opening handles without thin
  straps. SVJ is 50 kilos lighter than the Aventador S which is very much in this context. Especially since SVJ has 30
  more horsepower, a total of 770 horses.</p>

  <p>When you fold up the red flap on the center console that looks something like a fighter aircraft, the red start
  button is exposed. One push and the V12 comes to life. And it&#39;s a life that makes you jump high if you&#39;re not
  used to it. An deafening hissing sound rattles out through the two large round exhaust pipes in the center of the rear.
  However, when we talk about the rear, Aventador SVJ is nothing else. At the bottom is a giant carbon fiber diffuser to
  best conduct air under the car. This is also where part of the ALA system is located. In the middle where the exhaust
  pipes are located, it is metal, not plastic covers.</p>

  <p>At the top is the newly developed wing which ensures that the car holds the back end of the slope when it goes really
  fast. One of the few things you can notice is that the wing obscures all visibility backward. But on the other hand, it
  is the future you should look at if you have not done something stupid on the public road.</p>

  <p>Speaking of stupidity on the public road, it is quite difficult to keep the speed of such a car. Almost impossible.
  Autostradan offers great opportunities to drive fast and it is up to you how you handle any dealings with the police
  authorities.</p>

  <p>But the Italians are proud of their four-wheeled bulls and stallions. They love to drive fast and preferably on low
  gears so it sounds great. For my part, however, I am happy when I reach the mountains and the highway turns into winding
  mountain roads. Here you can drive fast in a completely different way without being an easy replacement for Polizia
  Stradale.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>On the way up to Passo Giau, as a driver, I really need to prove my worthiness as a driver</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On the way up to Passo Giau, as a driver, I really need to prove my worthiness as a driver. This car can drive harder
  than Mike Tyson&#39;s right hook. You will not win over the car and feel that it does not measure up. If you do, you
  probably belong in a racing team.<br />
  As a driver you feel everything going on under the car and the power is totally inexhaustible. Personally, I like the
  Lamborghini models very well thanks to the four-wheel drive. Unlike Aventador S, SVJ does not have the new four-wheel
  steering. The regular Aventador S is considerably nicer and more easily driven in the curves but with a firm grip SVJ
  also takes you where you want. But it is definitely a fight between you and the car. Although you agree on the goal: To
  get through the curves in the fastest way.</p>

  <p>At the top of the pass, I have to take a break. I&#39;m all over. Not the car, on the other hand, it can happily
  handle this without the slightest sign of fatigue. The rest of the car gets done naturally when you have to stop and
  fill up the tank. Something that happens relatively regularly if you let the car go full attack. Then the V12 engine
  requires copious amounts of fuel. But that is it, a large and strong bull like this requires a lot of food to deliver
  the maximum. It makes me go back to what I was talking about at the beginning of this article. Namely, that bull with
  devils embracing which, according to some, no longer exists. Aventador SVJ is the proof that they are wrong!</p>

  <p>The Japanese giant tiger prawn, Kuruma Ebi, is found in waters all around the coast of Japan.&nbsp; When boiled, it
  looks like a wheel, hence the name &ldquo;kuruma&rdquo; (wheel in japanese) &ldquo;ebi&rdquo; (prawn). &nbsp; Raw, it
  has a beautiful appearance, with a brown striped body and a tail fan contrasting red and blue.&nbsp; &nbsp; These prawns
  are also widely distributed from the western Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean.&nbsp; The one I am using is from
  Nigeria.</p>

  <p>Giant tiger prawns are very large in size, averaging between 20 -25 cms in length and have a sweet, fresh
  flavour.&nbsp; &nbsp; They are delicious just simply grilled with salt, pepper and lemon juice but taste especially good
  with yuzu pepper butter which you can either buy in a jar or make yourself (see recipe below). &nbsp; Try it. &nbsp; I
  am sure you will enjoy it.</p>

  <p><strong>Kuruma prawn with yuzu pepper butter</strong></p>

  <p>Ingredients:</p>

  <p>4 kuruma prawns (giant tiger prawns) &nbsp;&nbsp;Or you can use langoustine or lobster.</p>

  <p>Yuzu pepper butter:</p>

  <p>1/2 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p>1/2 tbsp unsalted butter (room temperature)</p>

  <p>1/2 tsp grated garlic</p>

  <p>1/2 tsp yuzu pepper paste</p>

  <p>Garnish:</p>

  <p>2tbsp pine nuts</p>

  <p>1tsp soy sauce</p>

  <p>salad leaves</p>

  <p>Directions:</p>

  <p>1. Mix all the yuzu pepper butter ingredients. Olive oil will be last.</p>

  <p>2. Make soy pine nuts.&nbsp; Set oven for 175 degrees C/350F/Gas Mark 4. Put pine nuts and soy sauce onto an oven
  tray in centre of oven.&nbsp; Cook 5 minutes.</p>

  <p>3. Cut prawn from the back between head and tail.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is easiest to cut through the shell using sharp
  scissors. &nbsp; In Japan we love the eat the meat from the head as a delicacy but it is not to everyone&#39;s
  taste.</p>

  <p>4. Open up but do not remove the shell and cut down the back of the prawn almost right through but not quite.
  &nbsp;</p>

  <p>5. Remove and discard the digestive tube.</p>

  <p>6. Spread 1tsp yuzu butter over the flesh of the prawn and grill for 5 minutes.</p>

  <p>7. Serve with soy flavoured pine nuts and salad.</p>

  <p><strong>Yuzu pepper paste</strong></p>

  <p>Japanese Yuzu citrus pepper paste is prepared with yuzu (<em>see Enliven article How to use a Yuzu</em>) and green
  chilli pepper.&nbsp; It has a refreshing scent and spicy taste and gives a kick to Japanese dishes. &nbsp; Originally
  yuzu pepper was used in Japanese hot pot dishes such as syabusyabu but it is now also found as a condiment for miso
  soup, sashimi, tempura, and grilled meat or fish.&nbsp; It is also used to make unique dressing or sauce.</p>

  <p>Most Japanese grocery stores carry yuzu pepper paste in bottles now but also you can make it. It is generally
  prepared with only yuzu, chili pepper and salt, but the one I will introduce here is fermented yuzu pepper with rice
  koji.&nbsp; The taste is improved by adding koji and of the delights is that the taste changes over time. &nbsp; During
  the fermentation and ageing process, the spiciness becomes mild and a more complex taste and flavour are produced.
  &nbsp; Also, it can be stored refrigerated for about 1 year. So, if you find the dried Koji, please add it!</p>

  <p>Ingredients:</p>

  <p>90g&nbsp; hot green chilli pepper</p>

  <p>90g&nbsp; Yuzu skin&nbsp; (you can use lemon or lime even tangerine! Instead of yuzu)</p>

  <p>45g&nbsp; Sea salt&nbsp; (if you don&rsquo;t use Koji, Sea salt will be 36g)</p>

  <p>40g&nbsp; Dried koji (fermented rice) (optional)</p>

  <p>90ml Warm water for Koji</p>

  <p>Directions:</p>

  <p>1. Soften the dried Koji in the warm water.</p>

  <p>2. Put yuzu skin and green chilli into food processor to chop finely but not to make paste adding salt and Koji
  last.</p>

  <p>3. Transfer the yuzu mixture to a pestle &amp; mortar and grind to a rough paste (not too smooth).</p>

  <p>4. Keep the Yuzu pepper in a clean jar in the refrigerator. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Without Koji you can keep the paste for up to 3 months in the fridge. &nbsp; With Koji it should last up to 1
  year.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/tiger-prawns-yuzu-pepper-butter</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/tiger-prawns-yuzu-pepper-butter</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 10:21:48 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Sue Atkinson, eico kano</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Majorcan Maximalism]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>On the sun-drenched island of Mallorca, Anna from Sweden has created an eclectic home where she lets her love of
  beautiful things set the rules.</p>

  <p>Behind a pair of heavy wooden gates, a somewhat theatrical world unfolds, with many beautiful things &ndash; and a
  magical garden flaunting in a tiny, simple backyard. When Anna Stenberg and her son moved from Sweden to Mallorca, not
  only did they pack their entire home,&nbsp;but also thirty&nbsp;boxwood shrubs!</p>

  <p><em>- I love gardens and I just couldn&rsquo;t let go of my shrubs. Totally crazy.</em></p>

  <p>Anna and her son Tedde wanted new energies in life and chose Mallorca because it felt pleasant, everyday nice,
  friendly and just the right distance from Sweden.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Anna left a farm and a man in Sk&aring;ne in favor of the Spanish, sun-drenched island 13 years
  ago</em>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>They initially moved to a 300-year-old and 300-square-meter-large stone house in the village of Binissalem, which was
  renovated from scratch. There were vineyards and beautiful nature, but also desolation.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; I was basically living in my car for one and a half years. Everything except for our home was in Palma:
  my&nbsp;son&rsquo;s school, his after-school activities, my job and our friends.</em></p>

  <p>Living in the old part of downtown Palma was their first choice, but instead, they ended up in a semi-detached house
  in the fashionable suburb of Bendinat. Anna says that the 175 sqm house was in a terrible condition, kind of unsexy and
  very poorly maintained since its construction in the early 80s. They had no choice but to start renovating every
  millimeter of the five rooms, a challenge they completed in nine months. Anna had no architect but a head full of ideas.
  She changed the layout of the house a little bit but left most of the walls untouched, as most of the structural
  integrity was in the many arches. She did however turn the garage into a kitchen. Anna&#39;s home is very cinematic with
  a lot of still-life elements. Not intentionally, she says; it just kind of happens.</p>

  <p><em>- I seldom make a sketch on paper, because the finished product won&rsquo;t look anything like it. I&rsquo;m just
  making it up as I go.</em></p>

  <p>Anna is happy to let art play the lead role in a home. It can be anything from established artists to friends. Or
  children. Her absolute favorite paintings hang above the bed.</p>

  <p><em>- If there&rsquo;s a fire, I&rsquo;m taking the three pictures that my son made when he was really young. He was
  sitting in my office making tiny characters out of price tags and stuff. They&rsquo;re super cool.</em></p>

  <p>Her favorite artist is Cy Twombly, sought after by numerous professionals.</p>

  <p><em>- I think art needs much more space in the homes of ordinary people. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be
  expensive; art can accomplish a lot in a home.</em></p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Once I had bought the house and got there for the first time, I actually started crying and thought: My God, what
  have I done?</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Anna has been a professional decorator for thirteen&nbsp;years and works with assignments mostly in Mallorca and in
  Sweden. She has also owned a restaurant, caf&eacute; and bakery, and worked in fashion. The love of beautiful things has
  always existed, and she likes to mix everything, old and new. No rules or frameworks, anything goes.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; I like classic, eclectic, modern, rural. It&rsquo;s almost like I just close my eyes and mix everything.
  I would never be able to work with anything that is exclusively modern or create something with nothing but antiques, I
  want to capture the essence of the world we live in. I used to buy loads and loads of magazines but now I just use
  Pinterest and Instagram. I follow decorators and art collectors, anyone who inspires me. It can be anything from food to
  clothing to art to gardens, you name it.</em></p>

  <p>Anna&#39;s best decorating tip is that nothing is off-limits.</p>

  <p><em>- Sometimes I have a complete drought and I start thinking about how I can get my inspiration back. Usually, all
  it takes is some beautiful fabric and I&rsquo;ll just go </em><em>wow</em><em>. But it&rsquo;s easy to get a little too
  comfortable. Never say no &ndash; if you like it, you like it, and nothing else matters. Don&rsquo;t get too timid, just
  put everything together, dare to mix. Express yourself through the room. Beautiful things are always beautiful
  together.</em></p>

  <p>When Anna is decorating, both privately and professionally, she starts off with a base color scheme. From there, she
  just goes all-out.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; I try to maintain a fairly neutral palette when it comes to the walls, floors and curtains. Maybe a couch
  in beige linen or worn black. Then I go completely nuts with pillows, decorations, things and art.</em></p>

  <p>Most of what Anna has in her home is from Sweden, especially the antiques. But some are from different trips, such as
  a couple of chairs that she has bought in Argentina.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; I&#39;m no stranger to hauling things. If I find something I like, I don&#39;t think about how I will get
  it home. I don&rsquo;t care, I&rsquo;m just going to bring it with me. Things with history and origins
  bring&nbsp;character.</em></p>

  <p>She is a collector of blue and white porcelain, or at least she used to be. Now&nbsp;she feels like she has a little
  too much of those two colors. Anna also likes African art such as masks.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; I&#39;m a bit of a hoarder unfortunately. I would like to minimalize my world a bit, but it is hard. I
  spend time online more or less daily because I&#39;m always on the hunt for something new, either for personal or
  professional use.</em></p>

  <p>Living in the old town of Palma is a dream of Anna&rsquo;s, but it would come at the price of a a less spacious
  apartment, meaning less space for all her things.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; If I were to move to Palma, I would have to downsize a bit. The same applies if I were to make my secret
  dream of a pied-&agrave;-terre in Paris come true. I love London and Paris... The extravagance and stucco of the
  apartments are amazing. They&rsquo;re almost excessive and I just love it!</em></p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/interior-design/majorcan-maximalism-from-sweden</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/interior-design/majorcan-maximalism-from-sweden</guid><category><![CDATA[Interior Design]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 13:00:43 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Stephanie Bjelkstam</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Master's New Garden]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Anders Mårtensson, gardener and garden designer has created his own oasis by mixing different styles.</p>

  <p>The six-meter tall bamboo Phyllostachys Aureosulcata Spectabilis rattles in the soft late summer wind and forms a
  waving shadow over the patio in the south.&nbsp;Next to the green striped trunks, the water ripples lazily.</p>

  <p>In Anders M&aring;rtensson&#39;s lush garden in Limhamn nothing has been left to chance.&nbsp;Yet, the experience of
  it is like a quiet forest glade created by Mother Nature herself.</p>

  <p>&mdash; I have worked a lot with different green shades and leaf shapes, contrasts between high and low, wild and
  trimmed.&nbsp;My whole life revolves around gardening, so I find harmony in the quiet greenery.&nbsp;My favorite seasons
  in the garden are May and October.&nbsp;The spring is for me a rebirth, the fern leaves bud out, the treetops become
  light green and the king bed lilies sprout on their narrow stems.&nbsp;In the spring I do proper cleaning of all the
  flower beds and then I put on a&nbsp;3-4&nbsp;cm thick layer of cow manure in all plantings.&nbsp;The plants thrive in
  the lean and nutritious soil and the take up a lot of space, which means that there is no room left for weeds&rdquo;,
  says Anders.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>I got my inspiration as a young boy in the forests around Br&ouml;sarps Backar</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In October, the garden explodes in dramatic colors such of red, orange and yellow, with the trees playing the leading
  role in this autumn sonata.</p>

  <p>&mdash; Trees are my passion, they add so much to a garden.&nbsp;They create height and tiers while at the same time
  filtering the light so beautifully.</p>

  <p>With the help of the sun, the Tibetan cherry trees glisten while the spindle tree leaves get fine autumn colors and
  the&nbsp;rowan tree&nbsp;blossoms with white&nbsp;rowan-berries.&nbsp;The Japanese maples have incredibly beautiful
  leaves in several different shades and reach a good intermediate height that ties together higher trees in the
  background with low plants in front, he explains.&nbsp;In the 380 square meter garden, each room has a patio created
  according to the prevailing light conditions so that there are always both sunny and shady places to be.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>My vision&nbsp;is to create places that are as beautiful during the day as during the evening</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&mdash; Two years ago we made an extension to our house.&nbsp;This changed the garden&#39;s character and left us
  with a larger&nbsp;wooden deck&nbsp;with both a dining area with pergola and a lounge section where the sun rays wander
  through the cherry tree leaves during the day. On the roof of the house we built a 35 square meter terrace which has
  full sun exposure from sun-up to sundown.&nbsp;The raised, paved patio is half shaded all day because of the trees
  which, at their base, are joined by different kinds of bamboo,&nbsp;hakenochloa, ferns, boxwood and&nbsp;plantain
  lilies, says Anders.</p>

  <p>In the evening, the garden changes shape thanks to the lighting.</p>

  <p>&mdash; My vision, both when it comes to my own garden but also&nbsp;when&nbsp;drawing others, is to create places
  that are as beautiful during the day as well as during the evening, all year round.&nbsp;Therefore, I often choose to
  build the gardens on a foundation of evergreen plants such as boxwood, ivy and bamboo.&nbsp;The trunks of the trees
  become a graphic element in the winter and the lighting creates a nice atmosphere in the evenings.</p>

  useful in both sweet and savoury dishes.   Eico Kano shares her recipe for Beetroot-Cured Salmon Salad with Yuzu
  dressing</p>

  <p><br />
  <strong>About Yuzu</strong></p>

  <p>Countering its unpreposessing appearance - rather like a small, deformed lemon - &quot;Yuzu&quot; is characterised by
  its unique refreshing scent. It&#39;s flavour is tart and fragrant, closely resembling that of the grapefruit, with
  overtones of mandarin orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it has a strong acidity, it cannot be eaten raw, but its juice or
  thinly-sliced peel is used to flavour both sweet and savoury foods and beverages including yuzu vinegar, yuzu pepper,
  yuzu miso, and soup, as well as jams, jellies, and juices like lemon.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Flavour is tart and fragrant, closely resembling that of the grapefruit, with overtones of mandarin
  orange</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The origin of Yuzu is China. But it is mostly used Japanese and Korean cuisines. This yuzu (the picture) came from my
  parents&#39; garden in Japan where it is as common to have your own yuzu tree as it is in the UK to have an apple tree.
  Since Spain &#39;s well-known restaurant, El Buzi, proclaimed Yuzu in a big way the use of Yuzu is spreading in Western
  dishes and modern cuisine.</p>

  <p>It may be difficult to find fresh yuzu.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is sometimes available in the freezer or small bottles of yuzu
  juice in Japanese food shops.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise you can easily buy yuzu juice on-line.&nbsp; Sometimes the bottled
  juice contains salt, in which case bear this in mind when you are cooking.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

  <p>There is also a great product call yuzu pepper, a combination of yuzu (sometimes known as Japanese citrus) and green
  chilli, which gives a real kick to Japanese dishes.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I will show you how to use this in the next recipe
  picture with a grilled Japanese tiger prawn.)</p>

  <p>Yuzu is available throughout the year, but the season is from November to December.<br />
  Japan has a custom of taking Yuzu-yu at the winter solstice.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said to promote blood circulation and
  moisturise the skin, so it is ideal for the cold and dry season.&nbsp; The scent of yuzu also has the effect of relaxing
  the nerves.</p>

  <p>If I can tell you more about Yuzu, it is rich in vitamin C.&nbsp; In particular, the citron peel contains as much as
  150 mg of vitamin C per 100 g.&nbsp; This is a value that exceeds 100 mg of vitamin C content in 100 g of the edible
  portion of lemon.</p>

  <p><strong>Cured Salmon Salad with Yuzu dressing (for 2)</strong></p>

  <p>Yuzu has a unique flavour but If you can&rsquo;t find yuzu, you can still make this recipe replacing the yuzu with
  grapefruit, lemon or lime.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just replace yuzu juice or skin with equal quantities in the recipe as
  appropriate. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Ingredients:</p>

  <p>100g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beetroot cured salmon (see below)<br />
  &nbsp; 20g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; baby kales or mizuna or rocket<br />
  100g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daikon<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yuzu skin (if available)<br />
  &nbsp; 45ml&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yuzu dressing (see below)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crispy lotus root (option)</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Ingredients for beetroot cured salmon<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp;300g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sashimi-grade salmon without skin<br />
  &nbsp;100g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; demerara sugar<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 50g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rock salt<br />
  &nbsp;1 tbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beetroot powder</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Ingredients for Yuzu dressing</p>

  <p>1/2tbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fresh yuzu&nbsp; juice<br />
  1/2tbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rice vinegar (mild vinegar)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp; 1 tbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soy sauce<br />
  &nbsp; 1 tbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; organic rapeseed oil</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>directions: &nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make beetroot cured salmon.&nbsp; Mix sugar, salt, and beetroot powder.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cover piece of salmon well with cure mix. Wrap it with cling film.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep in refrigerator for 36-48 hours.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unwrap the cling film and carefully wipe off the cure mixture.<br />
  5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Slice the cured salmon thinly and keep in the refrigerator.<br />
  6.&nbsp;&nbsp; To make yuzu dressing, mix all of the dressing ingredients.<br />
  7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash the salad. Thinly shred the daikon with a mandolin. (I use a Japanese katsuramuki*<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine.)&nbsp; Put shredded daikon in icy cold water to make it go crispy along with the
  kale until ready to serve.<br />
  8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrange the ingredients on a suitable plate and decorate with sliced yuzu skin and/or crispy vegetables
  such as lotus root or shredded leeks and also nuts such sliced almonds or pine nuts.<br />
  9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Serve with yuzu dressing.</p>

  <p><sup>*)&nbsp; &nbsp; katsuramuki is one of the most technical ways to slice vegetable paper-thin. It is turning the
  vegetable, such as daikon, carrot, or cucumber, and peeling it by hand lengthways without breaking it. So you have to
  use a very sharp knife.&nbsp; And you need considerable skill.</sup></p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/how-use-yuzu</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/how-use-yuzu</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 17:01:25 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Sue Atkinson, eico kano</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Making your own Miso and Miso recipes]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Japanese chef and cookery write Eico Kano shares her family's authentic miso recipes.</p>

  <p>Miso is a traditional Japanese food and also a healthy fermented food.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three types of miso:
  rice miso, wheat miso and bean miso.&nbsp;&nbsp; 80% of the miso produced in Japan is rice miso.</p>

  <p>I make rice miso.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ingredients are really simple: rice koji (malted rice), soya beans,
  salt.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can buy malted rice from a Japanese shop/ on-line.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use organic soya beans and
  natural Japanese sea salt.</p>

  <p>This is my family recipe:</p>

  <p>700g soya beans<br />
  1250g rice koji (malted rice)<br />
  350g sea salt</p>

  <p>1.&nbsp; Wash and soak the soya beans in clean water over night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reserve a little of the water in case
  you need to moisten the miso later.<br />
  2.&nbsp; Cook the soya beans until completely soft (a pressure cooker will save you time).<br />
  3.&nbsp; Meanwhile, break the koji into flakes with your fingers and mix well with the salt.<br />
  4.&nbsp; Clean a 2 kg storage container with Vodka (or any alcohol).<br />
  5.&nbsp; While the cooked beans are still warm, mash them with a potato masher (or use a blender) to puree the beans
  until about two-thirds are pureed, leaving one third whole.<br />
  6.&nbsp; Add koji mixture and mix well.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the mixture is too dry, add a little of the reserved soaking
  water.<br />
  7.&nbsp; Form the miso mixture into balls to force out any air.<br />
  8.&nbsp; Throw the balls to hit the inside bottom corner of the container to make sure the air is out.<br />
  9.&nbsp; Continue throwing in hard until all the mixture is in the container and flatten the surface.<br />
  10.&nbsp; Spread with a little more salt to cover the surface thinly.<br />
  11.&nbsp; Cover with cling film, forcing out any air pockets and put on lid.<br />
  12.&nbsp; Store in a cool, dry, dark place for 6-8 months when the miso should be ready.</p>

  <p>You can keep it for longer and the miso will become darker and eventually red miso as in the photograph.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The colour of the miso indicates its maturity which relates with the Maillard reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were to use
  malted soya beans (bean miso) the colour would also be the darker, red, miso. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Each area of Japan has its own recipe so we have many varieties of miso in Japan.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Vegetable miso soup</p>

  <p>Miso soup (2-3 bowls)<br />
  Ingredients:<br />
  2 cups dashi (see recipe below)<br />
  2 tbsp miso<br />
  any root vegetables, mushrooms or green vegetables<br />
  (in the picture carrot, konnyaku, shitake, eddo, lotus root cut to shapes but they do not need to be!)<br />
  1 spring onion, very finely shredded<br />
  or chili finely chredded or shichimi pepper</p>

  <p>Dashi (vegetarian soup stock)<br />
  4 cups water<br />
  1/3 oz kombu (dried kelp) (10g or 4&quot;x4&quot;/ 10cm x 10cm)</p>

  <p>Directions:<br />
  1. To make dashi (can be made in advance and any spare frozen).<br />
  Clean kombu with a damp cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp; The white substance is UMAMI so you don&#39;t need to worry to clean too
  much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soak the kombu in water for 30 minutes or over night.&nbsp;&nbsp; After 30 minutes the kombu will be
  re-hydrated.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is kombu dashi and can be kept in the fridge for up to 5 days (with kombu).</p>

  <p>2. In a saucepan or soup pot heat kombu dashi and root vegetables. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer until they
  become tender. If you would like to add green vegetables, cook separately and add at last minute so as not to
  over-cook.</p>

  <p>3. Put miso into a ladle and slowly add the soup into the ladle to dissolve miso completely using chopsticks or a
  fork.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn off the heat.</p>

  <p>4. Serve with spring onion or chili pepper.</p>

  <p>Miso-marinated black cod</p>

  <p>Ingredients:<br />
  100g white miso (ie 6-8 months aged)<br />
  1 tbs sake<br />
  45g sugar<br />
  1/2 tsp grated root ginger<br />
  120g x 4 black cod steaks*</p>

  <p>Directions:<br />
  1.&nbsp; Boil sake and sugar until sugar dissolves.</p>

  <p>2. Combine sugar mix, miso and ginger and stir together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool to room temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
  the miso marinade.&nbsp; Place in a container large enough to hold the fish.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

  <p>3. Place the fish in the container and coat both sides with miso mix.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seal with cling film or parchment
  paper and refrigerate for 2-3 days.</p>

  <p>4. Pre-heat oven to 200C/400F, gas Mk6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gently wipe excess miso mix from fish.</p>

  <p>5. Place fish skin side up in a baking tin lined with parchment paper.</p>

  <p>6. Bake the fish until the edges of the skin are browned and it is cooked through - about 15-20 minutes but do not
  over-cook.</p>

  <p>7. Carefully remove the fish from the pan with a spatula.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

  <p>8. Serve immediately with char-grilled vegetables such as asparagus, courgette, fennel etc.</p>

  <p>* This miso marinade can also be used for<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grill: salmon, mackerel or chicken.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Searing : beef, lamb or duck<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curing : vegetables, cheese and raw fish</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking-recipes/making-your-own-miso-and-miso-recipes</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking-recipes/making-your-own-miso-and-miso-recipes</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Recipes]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 10:46:09 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Sue Atkinson, eico kano</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[6 Questions to Ismael Álvarez, Head Sommelier at Nerua in Bilbao ]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Ismael Álvarez, Head Sommelier at the critically acclaimed and Guide Michelin restaurant Nerua, located in the
  Guggenheim museum, guides you to the best wine bars in the Basque Country.</p>

  <p><sub>He grew up on a small vineyard just outside </sub><sub>Madrid,</sub><sub> and has worked at several exclusive
  taverns before arriving in Bilbao seven years ago.&nbsp;Working with wine was not an obvious line of work for
  Ismael.&nbsp;He is a trained chef but quickly realized that the chef trade meant a lot more than reading cookbooks and
  cooking for friends. Instead, he realized that it was in the wine world where he was the most at home. The constant
  development of wine, new vintages and challenges give him energy, just as the feedback he receives from
  Nerua&#39;s</sub><sub> guests. Ismael says there are three things that make a restaurant experience special: &ldquo;You
  should eat well, feel well and drink well&rdquo;.</sub></p>

  <p><sub><strong>&mdash;How do&nbsp;you work with kitchen manager&nbsp;Josean&nbsp;Alija?</strong></sub></p>

  <p><sub>&mdash;We work great together.&nbsp;Among other things, I have a chef&#39;s jacket with my name on it, as I
  often am in the kitchen with Josean when new dishes are created.&nbsp;The scent of new food that is being cooked gives
  me inspiration.</sub></p>

  <p><sub><strong>&mdash;You have a rather short but well-defined wine list, how do you go about creating
  it?</strong></sub></p>

  <p><sub>&mdash;I want it to be dynamic.&nbsp;Guests should be able to quickly and easily decide which wine they
  want.&nbsp;The wine bottles are here to be opened and the guests are here to enjoy them.</sub></p>

  <p><sub><strong>&mdash;Do you have any wine pairings that you have been particularly pleased with?</strong></sub></p>

  <p><sub>&mdash;It is very difficult to pair wine with artichoke.&nbsp;We had a dish with artichoke, bone marrow and
  lentil broth paired with De Muller, a wine from Catalonia from 1926. 1926 was the year when the
  architect&nbsp;Gaud&iacute; passed away.&nbsp;The wine is made in his honor, and the wine pairing was an amazing
  experience, both in taste and emotionally.</sub></p>

  <p><sub><strong>&mdash;If you invite friends to dinner at home, what do you drink?</strong></sub></p>

  <p><sub>&mdash;A simpler wine.&nbsp;With </sub><sub>friends</sub><sub> you should drink something that is opened, drunk
  and runs out, like Querido Toribio from Cantabria, an area where they usually do not do make a lot of wine.</sub></p>

  <p><sub><strong>&mdash;And&nbsp;food?</strong></sub></p>

  <p><sub>&mdash;Cocido, a well-known Spanish soup with chickpeas as a base.&nbsp;For that you can also drink champagne,
  it works for everything!</sub></p>

  <p><sub><strong>&mdash;Which wine bars do you like to go to?</strong></sub></p>

  <p><sub>&mdash;I have two here in the Basque Country, Cork in Bilbao, with many wines by the glass and a wine list that
  is constantly changing, and the&nbsp;Essencia&nbsp;Wine Bar in San Sebasti&aacute;n. Angelita Madrid in Madrid is
  amazing.&nbsp;They also have a wine list that is constantly changing.&nbsp;A menu is constantly alive, so why should the
  wine list not be so as well?</sub></p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/ismael-alvarez-sommelier-nerua-guggenheim-bilbao</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/ismael-alvarez-sommelier-nerua-guggenheim-bilbao</guid><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 09:05:13 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Tove Oskarsson Henckel</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[A shady spot for a Secret path]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Bring life into a dull corner with the simplest narrow walkway and shade-loving plants.</p>

  <p>If your garden has a dull, shady, problem area then the solution might be to cut a small pathway through it, add some
  shade-loving plants and create a secret corner.&nbsp; A bird-bath, obelisk, old tree-trunk, a piece of ancient gardening
  or farm equipment or - better still - a piece of decorative garden ceramics can even turn it into a real
  feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how I feel about the darker, most un-fertile part of my long narrow strip which is
  enlivened by the delightful organic forms of &quot;Summer&quot; by ceramist <a href="http://www.dianaroles.co.uk">Diana
  Roles</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>If your garden has a dull, shady, problem area - cut a small pathway through it, add some shade-loving plants and
  create a secret corner</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>My path also has a very functional role.&nbsp;&nbsp; While I number myself among those who cannot conceive of a
  garden being complete without grass, I have long-since resigned myself to the idea that I will never - in my overcrowded
  long narrow patch - be able to cultivate anything that truly resembles a lawn.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, I content myself
  with what a friend describes as a large grass path! As this forms part of the framework of the view from my kitchen I
  try my best to keep it as green as possible, avoiding walking on it, which means I need another route for getting to and
  fro.</p>

  <p>Using bricks re-cycled from an old demolished wall, bedded on a good layer of sand, I placed just two widths side by
  side to form a gentle curve leading from the top of the garden and straightening out along the side of the garden
  leaving a shallow border by the fence.</p>

  <p>Several plants reproduce themselves plentifully in fairly dry shade and can easily become thugs amongst which I
  number Lily of the Valley and Ground Elder but the variegated form Aegopodium Podagraria &#39;Variegatum&#39; is most
  attractive and largely confined by the path.&nbsp; Height is given by a metal obelisk supporting the free-flowering
  blue/purple Clematis Bonanza who is happy to keep its feet in the shade and reach up to the sun.</p>

  <p><strong>Plants featured</strong><br />
  Euonymus Fortunei Silver Queen and Emerald &#39;n&#39; Gold&#39;, Lily of the valley<br />
  Epimedium x Warleyense &#39;Orangekonigin&#39; growing in amongst Aegopodium Podagraria &#39;Variegatum&#39; -
  Variegated ground elder, Perennial Geranium Phaeum and Pulmonaria Officinalis<br />
  While Euonymus are not exactly ground-cover plants and can grow up to a 1m, if kept well trimmed from initial planting
  they can remain small and compact with the wonderful property of being ever-green.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trim top shoots and
  laterals in May and again in September.</p>

  <p><br />
  Spring-flowering Lily of the Valley must be one of the best-loved scented cottage garden plants but beware - it is both
  highly poisonous and can become invasive.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are woodland plants so thrive in shade.&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the
  right conditions it will gradually march westwards across your garden via runners which pop up wherever they feel like
  it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Happily they do not go too deep so are fairly easy to remove unless they become entangled with other
  roots.</p>

  <p><br />
  Epimediums flower in a variety of colours, some thriving in even extremely dry shade.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my garden the
  orange form Epimedium x warleyense &#39;Orangekonigin&#39; is slightly less prolific than the yellow Epimedium x
  versicolor &#39;Sulphureum&#39; with flowers like the tiniest of daffodils, but it seems happy in conjunction with the
  variegated Ground Elder Aegopodium podagraria &#39;Variegatum&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people like to cut the leaves back
  in order to see the flowers to best advantage which delays the fresh new leaf growth.</p>

  <p><br />
  Geranium Phaeum is a clump-forming perennial also known as the Mourning Widow after the dark purple colour of its purple
  flowers although paler lilac and white forms are now available.&nbsp; It&#39;s not exactly ground-cover and can grow up
  to between 0.5 and 1metre but, given a little support, works well alongside a path and if cut back hard after flowering
  the leaves will re-grow.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also good for attracting bees, birds and other pollinators.</p>

  <p><br />
  Pulmonaria or Lungwort is a favourite of mine, again available in different colour forms but officinalis is the most
  reliable.&nbsp; The attractive slightly hairy, spotted leaves are lovely on their own but the bonus is the stems of
  bright blue flowers which softly fade to mauve and pink which appear early in the spring when few other plants are in
  bloom.&nbsp; It grows quickly in part to full shade and can easily be divided and transplanted.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the
  leaves begin to look tatty just cut them back and they will re-grow.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>While the mere thought of Ground Elder or Bishop&#39;s Weed strikes horror in the minds of some gardeners, the
  variegated form, Aegopodium podagraria &#39;Variegatum&#39;&nbsp; is a very attractive plant and useful if you have an
  area of poor soil in dry shade area you need to cover.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Lily of the Valley, it spreads via its root
  system so it&#39;s good to have an underground barrier to stop it going beyond where it is wanted!&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep
  an eye on it.&nbsp; Apparently the common form was introduced into the UK by the Romans as a food so you can eat the
  young leaves and flowers but not the roots.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/shady-spot-secret-path</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/shady-spot-secret-path</guid><category><![CDATA[Garden]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 14:19:47 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Sue Atkinson</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rhubarb and Strawberry Pie]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>It is rhubarb and strawberry season – no better time than now to make this perfect pie!

  automotive sky.</p>

  <p>For more than fifteen years I have been familiar with the family business from &Auml;ngelholm that celebrated its
  25th-anniversary last year. I&rsquo;ve lost count of the number of visits, test drives and photoshoots I&rsquo;ve done
  at the factory, but they never cease to impress.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Koenigsegg is in good shape!</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To build a brand from scratch as successfully as Christian and his family have done is a fantasy for most and a
  reality for a limited few. Christian definitely realized his dream to build his own hyper sports car that is stronger,
  faster and more exclusive than anything anyone has ever seen!</p>

  <p><em>- Koenigsegg is in good shape! We have produced about half of the Regeras and in less than a year we will start
  the production of the Jesko. We also just unveiled two new models: Gemera and Jesko Absolut.</em></p>

  <p>The big release is the Gemera, a four-seater model with the classification &quot;Mega-GT&quot;. It is a car designed
  for four adults with plenty of space as well as entertainment in the form of a large screen in the back. Self-driving
  features and other amenities will also be available, while simultaneously being fast enough to give any two-seated
  hyper- or mega car a run for their money. The car has got a warm welcome from customers, dealers and the media after its
  release and the orders are already stacking up.</p>

  <p>The name Gemera combines the Swedish words &quot;ge&quot; and &quot;mera&rdquo;, give more, which is exactly what the
  car does. One of the biggest innovations of the Gemera is the engine, designed with the new Freevalve technology.
  Christian and the company have worked on it for 20 years now and it is finally ready to be released. I remember one of
  my early visits to the factory when Christian showed me a special room where the Freevalve experiments were carried out.
  Christian has high hopes that Freevalve is here to stay, since it makes CO2 neutrality a possibility, reduces emissions
  and can utilize existing infrastructure in the form of refueling stations.</p>

  <p>The engine has the cute nickname &quot;Tiny Friendly Giant&quot; because of its strength and its low impact on the
  environment. 300 units of the Gemera will be produced in brand new 10,000 square meter facilities starting in 2022.</p>

  <p>The second model presented is Jesko Absolut. It is not an entirely new model, but it also has not been physically
  revealed yet. The original Jesko model premiered at last year&#39;s car show in Geneva and comes in two versions: a
  track-oriented version and a high-speed one, the latter being Jesko Absolut. It will be exciting to see what the
  distribution between the two will be.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Koenigsegg still holds the record for the fastest serially produced and street-approved car model</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When asked whether a customer will put the top speed of Jesko Absolut to the test, Christian had no answer to give.
  But when they broke the world record for serially produced cars in 2017 (447 km/h), a customer did courteously lend his
  car for the attempt. However, it was the factory&#39;s test driver at the time, Niklas Lilja, who performed the
  feat.</p>

  <p>The quest to be the strongest and fastest is a continuously ongoing one. Bugatti tried to put Koenigsegg in its place
  last year by exceeding the glorious limit of 300 miles per hour. Christian, however, is quick to point out that
  Koenigsegg still holds the record for the fastest serially produced and street-approved car model. The Bugatti was a
  specially equipped prototype and the company themselves acknowledged that customer cars will not be as fast. Bugatti has
  also said that they will not continue the pursuit of breaking speed records, which is probably a wise choice considering
  how extreme the speeds have become. At this point, they are more hypothetically interesting than functional, and
  Christian is prepared to agree.</p>

  <p>When it comes to the function and technology of sports cars in the future, Christian compares them to horses having
  transitioned from serving a logistical purpose to a recreational one. Christian predicts that the same will happen with
  sports cars. When ordinary cars disappear and are replaced by self-driving &quot;pods&quot; shared between people in
  different forms, the sports cars will remain as a form of entertainment, potentially driven on public roads but more
  likely exclusively on racetracks.</p>

  <p>The automotive industry is facing an unprecedented paradigm shift since its birth about 130 years ago, says
  Christian. It is becoming increasingly evident that the big actors who have dominated for the last 50 years no longer
  have their advantages. Their historical strengths - implementation and product quality, are not as important as they
  used to be. Today, it is crucial to provide the latest solutions in terms of technology, connectivity, and comfort, and
  these companies find it difficult to change fast enough since innovation is not their key strength.</p>

  <p>Many customers are fine with quality coming in second, something that was unthinkable just five years ago. This has
  given the German actors a bit of a headache. The playing field has changed so much they have no idea where to start.
  When it comes to new technology and powertrains, Christian believe that electric cars are usually better than the cars
  they replaced, especially when it comes to shorter distances where lightweight batteries can be used.</p>

  <p>For long distances, however, the added weight of the heavier batteries leads to increased friction and reduced
  driving dynamics. The charging stations are also few and far between. The best solution for long-distance driving is to
  combine electricity with next-generation carbon-neutral biofuels such as ethanol, methanol and the electromethanol
  Vulcanol. These alternative fuels can easily replace the gas at the gas stations, so the infrastructure is already
  available and paid for. The Koenigsegg Gemera will be the first car in the world to offer this combination. As an energy
  source, the sun is obviously the optimal one considering it generates energy whether we like it or not. Solar energy can
  be harvested using solar cells, while wind- or wave-power are other examples of ways to generate electricity.</p>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, Koenigsegg is a family business, which can obviously be an advantage as well as a disadvantage.
  Christian says one of the positive aspects is that he cares even more about his baby - the company is like a family
  member in itself. The downside of that, however, is that it is hard to relax and keep work and family separate. It might
  also be considered harder to progress in a family company compared to other ones. He does emphasize that he and his wife
  Halldora, who is the COO, are quick to separate themselves from contexts in order to give freedom to the organization
  below them.</p>

  <p>Eventually, they want to reach a point where the company functions well without them &ndash; but where they can still
  contribute when needed. Successfully building a company like Koenigsegg requires incredible navigation skills and
  dexterity. Highs and lows are part of any modern business, and for more than 25 years as a company, Koenigsegg has had
  the ability to cope with blows to the economy, often because not every part of the world has been affected at the same
  time. The units to be produced within the next few years have already sold, and with small volumes come great chances of
  further opportunities.</p>

  <p><em>- Through ups and downs, my motto as an entrepreneur is &ndash; keep your feet on the ground and your head in the
  clouds at the same time. Keep it real while daring to dream and realize, or else everything will be the same.</em></p>

  <p>The keyword for Koeningsegg has been flexibility. It has taken them through all major global crises so far, financial
  or otherwise. You have to find the common denominator and make the most of it. Also, when things go well, always expect
  it to get worse. That way you won&rsquo;t be surprised when it does. But obviously hard times put more pressure on you
  as an entrepreneur. Christian has noticed that when things get rocky, he often settles in quickly because the first ten
  years of the company were just that - rocky. Now, he is used to that, almost comfortable with it. Smooth sailing can
  sometimes be harder because the positive domino effect associated with it can be foreign and hard to deal with if you
  are used to struggling. It is simply just as important to get it right in good times as in bad times, or else you fall
  flat when it gets harder again.</p>

  <p>When asked if he thinks Koenigsegg will be bigger than Volvo one day, Christian prefers not to answer. The future is
  obviously very hard to predict, but the goal of Koenigsegg is neither to be the biggest nor bigger than any other actor.
  The goal is simply to do what they do best. Growth comes as a result of a mission well accomplished, while being
  cautious enough to grow without putting the company in too much danger.</p>

  <p><em>I would rather see our solutions, concepts, and technologies helping the automotive industry as a whole &ndash;
  that is where I think we can beat Volvo and many others in the industry.</em></p>

  <p>With Gemera, Koenigsegg is also stretching the limits of technology in the sense that the number of manufactured
  units is increasing compared to previous models, which means that the price will be slightly lower. That said, it is
  still a very expensive car for the vast majority. However, Christian and his company do have a plethora of ideas for
  future cars and vehicles, a concluding sentence implying that there are more visits, test runs and photoshoots in store
  for me in the foreseeable future.</p>

  the unexpected.</p>

  <p><strong>Why do you paint?</strong></p>

  <p>I painted my first oil painting when I was about ten years old; my grandmother was an artist and she taught me the
  basics, and since then I evolved to be painting in my boy&#39;s room, really motivated. I didn&#39;t stop since then, I
  guess. Maybe I had some interruptions: I had to make a living, get a job, do something creative to make a
  living...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>There was always a creative vibe present in the family.</strong></p>

  <p>Oh, yeah. My father was an actor. My mother is an artist too, but she developed her artistic side later on in her
  life. She was an actress in the beginning, then she transformed into director and after that started to write stuff for
  tv and theater. She&#39;s been freelancing for almost all her life: Dramaten, Riksteatern, SVT&hellip; My sister is a
  theater director too. I&#39;m home blind, you can say, totally. I&#39;m grown into the whole scenario, the art interest
  was always vivid in my family.</p>

  <p><strong>Creating, planning for your upcoming exhibitions or thinking of new ideas &ndash; what are you putting more
  time into nowadays?</strong></p>

  <p>I&#39;m in some kind of Limboland right now. I&#39;m not really creating for the time being, but thinking, feeling
  and brewing; that&#39;s constantly happening, which is both a gift and a curse, because sometimes is a lot of fun, but
  sometimes you want to have a break too. But the active painting&hellip; I&#39;m not in this right now because it&#39;s
  been so much around me. It&#39;s been crazy, actually. I just did this commercial for a well-known upscale car brand in
  Portugal.</p>

  <p><strong>What were you doing there?</strong></p>

  <p>I don&#39;t know, unbelievable things happened. Somebody just contacted me and said, &ldquo;we are shooting this
  commercial and we want you to play yourself&rdquo;. They just flew me down there and took me to this film shoot. I
  thought it was going to be average, but it was like a Hollywood-style production. So it was crazy, really. This gave me
  light post-traumatic stress. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;, you know what I mean? That was an unexpected event. This
  month I have this show in Stockholm, here at Le Studio 5, on the 27th, and after that I will be at the Affordable Art
  Fair with Singulart, a French gallery that will have me as an artist. I will have more paintings in Hamburg, which is
  the month after. So there&#39;s not really that much painting on now, which is kind of terrible, I think. That&#39;s
  where I feel more at home.</p>

  <p><strong>You follow a special workflow: before painting, you start by visualizing the sounds and motion this painting
  will somehow provoke you, and from there&nbsp;you start creating the actual painting. Is this vision that you get from
  the artwork anyhow affected by your surroundings?</strong></p>

  <p>Maybe the colors and the tone of the shapes are affected by how I feel, but otherwise the process&hellip; I read
  something some other artist said about inventing something new through mistakes or failures. It&#39;s like playing: you
  see something that turns you on, that feels visually right, some volume at the beginning of the creative process, and
  then you work from there. It&#39;s growing and suddenly it&#39;s just there, really. Sometimes it fails; then you just
  start over or work from that, but that&#39;s the essence of the process.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>I&#39;m stuck to the painting,&nbsp;I don&#39;t know why. It&#39;s the square, the limitations. I like
  that</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>Do you fabricate your own paint and materials?</strong></p>

  <p>No, never did. I used to work in oil, but I stopped the oil painting a few years ago because it took too much time;
  the process cools down when it has to dry for so many days to be able to continue, you lose the tempo. Before that, oil
  paint was my thing: it&#39;s classical, it brings a different, organic feel&hellip; But then I changed my mind and I
  started to paint with acrylics. I mix up a lot of stuff. Sometimes I have regular wall paint, also floor paint - it
  gives crazy shine. I&#39;m kind of wild when it comes to the paint quality. Wall paint is the best; eggshell white,
  it&#39;s like water paint, and it gives this eggshell matt feeling. When I&#39;m finishing, I put some protection. I use
  glossy varnish for some parts and matt varnish on others. If you see it when the light comes from the side, you will
  notice. I&#39;m going to shift to oil painting this year though, I&#39;ve missed it. The slower progress.</p>

  <p><strong>Is there any other technique that you really enjoy besides painting, that you ever wanted to use in your
  practice?</strong></p>

  <p>No. I think I&#39;m stuck to the painting,&nbsp;I don&#39;t know why. It&#39;s the square, the limitations. I like
  that.</p>

  <p><strong>I heard that you used to play music and sing as well.</strong></p>

  <p>Yes, I did a few tunes on the laptop. Actually like six albums. Gave it up to focus on my painting, though. Nowadays
  I just play guitar: I&#39;m trying to play the blues as well as possible. Sometimes I just make a song and put it on the
  Soundcloud or so.</p>

  <p><strong>You educated yourself into arts from a young age and eventually applied to the Art Students League of New
  York when you were 23. Why there? What were the most significant differences you found between art schools in Stockholm
  and New York?</strong></p>

  <p>I was living a lost life in Sweden. I was deejaying on bars, partying&hellip; I had no purpose. A friend of mine went
  there and told me to apply, so I just thought, &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;, and then everything was fine, <em>no
  problemos</em>. I used to paint in my small apartment in the south of Stockholm, but when I came there it surprised me,
  actually; it made me more focused, I took the whole painting more seriously. I found the start of my artistic language.
  In Stockholm I went to Basis Konstskola, and I also did some courses at Folkuniversitetet, but I don&#39;t think they
  taught me anything; maybe how to stretch a canvas. I felt that I already had an idea of what I wanted to do from the
  beginning, since I already experimented so much before, but then I was doing the still life painting and all that stuff.
  I think the Art Students League of New York was totally free. You just painted and somebody who was an actual artist, in
  this case Andrew Lukach, a New York painter, came and shared his thoughts. He was just circulating, sometimes stopping
  and saying, &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s beautiful! I don&#39;t know about this part, though&rdquo;. It was more
  inspiring.</p>

  <p><strong>While living in New York you sold your first painting. Did this first sale have any impact on your decision
  of becoming a fulltime painter?</strong></p>

  <p>It did. There is a before and after. I already had this idea of producing at least one or two paintings a month,
  because I was always working on something, but it was a before and after, definitely. I was surprised, of course, but at
  the same time I expected it: I had more of a cocky attitude, and maybe unrealistic ideas.</p>

  <p><strong>How did it feel to be here, once you decided to move back to Stockholm, and how did you reintroduce yourself
  into the local art scene?</strong></p>

  <p>The only reason I stayed in New York was that I met this woman and we got married. Then when we broke up I had
  nothing there to do, I wasn&#39;t there because I was so in love with the city, like, &ldquo;wow, this is New
  York!&rdquo;. Of course in the beginning it was a kick, many times, but I moved back to Sweden just because, you know,
  I&#39;m Swedish. This is my home. So after staying in New York for four years, when I came back I thought, &ldquo;now
  I&#39;m ready, I&#39;m going to have some shows and it will be fine&rdquo;. But it didn&#39;t work out, so I put away
  the painting for a little bit. This was when film started to turn digital. I took one semester at a film school in
  Stockholm and I noticed that I had some talent for editing; you have to have some kind of musical rhythm, of narrative
  knowledge. So I stopped painting and started to go into film, just to support myself, because otherwise it would have
  been a big problem. I was making music videos, commercials&hellip; Back then it paid really well, it was crazy. I did
  this for a few years until I couldn&#39;t take it anymore because it was draining me.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>You lose your faith in what you do, and then you find it, and when you find it is even stronger and you challenge
  yourself</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>It&#39;s very common among artists to have a side job that pays the bills, probably not arts-related at all,
  so it feels really inspiring to meet people&nbsp;decided to make a living out of their artistic practice and that
  actually make it. How did you manage to establish yourself in the business?</strong></p>

  <p>After being back for a while I decided to quit the film editing and just started painting. I didn&#39;t think about
  if it would work or not, it was a kamikaze thing. It was a quite turbulent time; I had a substance abuse going on, which
  of course was escalating. I was drinking and smoking marihuana. But I didn&#39;t do that all the time: I was painting
  and then rewarding myself, like a start-up strategy. It was really bad, but on the other hand I didn&#39;t think of my
  future, plans or any consequences very much because of the substance abuse, so that was a positive thing. I think if I
  would have been totally aware and sober, I would have thought &ldquo;this is not going to work&rdquo;.</p>

  <p><strong>Which do you think could be a good city for your career, if you moved again?</strong></p>

  <p>I think Sweden is great, in many ways. This is where I&#39;m born and raised. I believe maybe a quarter of the year
  would be good to be away; January, February, March. If I would go somewhere to paint, I would need maybe a little bit of
  sun; it makes it easy, inspiring.</p>

  <p><strong>It&#39;s funny that you say you would enjoy some sun.&nbsp;&rsquo;Confusion&rsquo; was the first thing that
  came to my mind when I saw your paintings&nbsp;for the first time.</strong></p>

  <p>It is confusion. Life is confusion. There&#39;s no clarity here. A little bit of obscure confusion, why not? I have
  darkness, of course; there is more of a nostalgic tragedy, I guess.</p>

  <p><strong>Your work has been exhibited in all kinds of venues: from galleries and showrooms to cultural centers and
  prestigious art fairs like Miami Art Week or Art Dubai, and even at a castle. Which type of venues fits better your
  personality?</strong></p>

  <p>First of all, when it comes to let&#39;s say Miami Art Fair, it might sound huge but the range of paintings sold
  there is up to $10 million, and I&#39;m on the lowest of the lowest. But being there is great because you lose your
  faith in what you do, and then you find it, and when you find it is even stronger and you challenge yourself. My
  paintings sell for $4000, that&#39;s nothing for an art collector. They don&#39;t even consider it collectible, just
  because it&#39;s too cheap. You have to go up to $10000; then you are a blue-chip, a maybe-collectible. I have a friend
  there, an agent and old buddy from the New York days, who hooked me up with Moti Vinograd. I was showing my art in his
  gallery during the Miami Art Week and the Aqua Art Miami last year. It was an adventure for my own sake, but I did some
  business too. I stayed at my agent&#39;s place; he is a quite wealthy broker now and has a spot for me where I can work
  and stay for a few months. I was under his wing a little bit and we were just hanging out. It was great.</p>

  <p><strong>Thanks to the Internet, and especially to social media, it&#39;s easier than ever to promote your work and
  reach a wider audience. Are you taking advantage of this kind of platforms, or do you keep it old school?</strong></p>

  <p>I have to be very grateful for the Internet. It brought me sales and it brought me contacts, in many ways. My
  homepage brought me a lot of private collectors coming to my studio and taking three paintings. It would have been very
  hard to reach out without it. It also brought me in contact with Singulart, the online French gallery that will
  represent me in the Affordable Art Fair. You buy one of those ads for twenty bucks and you can just spot the location,
  grow the range&hellip; it&#39;s great.</p>

  <p><strong>We at Enliven believe that artists and their work should have a bigger presence. What is your vision for a
  great platform for artists?</strong></p>

  <p>I have a great idea: a camera, and you shooting while we talk. That would be interesting for people to see. I think
  people want to see other people meeting, because we are so far away from that now, when people talk through computers,
  but meeting is not that common anymore.</p>

  <p><strong>Do your kids paint?</strong></p>

  <p>Yes, but more like kids do. They come and see my shows, but my son has seen my &rsquo;behind-the-scenes&rsquo;. I had

Greet our preferred one, King George <span class="caps">VIII</span>. We put on our best suits
  and met the producer to listen to his music and talk about his upcoming plans.</p>

  <p><strong>Tell us a bit about your life journey so we can understand why a Norwegian is making such good, warm
  beats.</strong></p>

  <p>I was born in Trondheim, and my family moved back to Accra, Ghana in 2000, when I was six. I went to primary school
  there and I think a lot of my world view, taste and preferences were formed in those years. Then I came back to Norway
  when I was thirteen and continued my schooling there. It was in this period that I met my friends who I started playing
  in a band with.</p>

  <p><strong>Which band?</strong></p>

  <p>We were called LDE. We played shameless electropop. It was brilliant. In that period I was an indie boy, finding
  indie bands all over the place. Then we began to play more electronic stuff; I was really enjoying bringing the
  electronic into my playing of drums. Then I bought my first drum pad, and that was the kickstart to producing music,
  because on the pad I could create every sound that I wanted. My little brother Gilbert was already producing music at
  that time and he showed me the basics. That was 2011 and since then I have spent my ten thousand hours, just producing
  music. I began with electronic, of course, because back then we were all EDM people.</p>

  <p>In 2015 I started thinking that I could produce. I wasn&rsquo;t any good, I was okay. I wanted to make music that
  sounded like home to me, so I went all the way back to the music I used to listen in Ghana when I was growing up, and I
  used to listen to a bunch of hiplife [hip hop mixed with afropop] and highlife music [R&amp;B mixed with afrobeats, with
  Akan roots]. I listened to so much highlife music when I was growing up; I used to stand in the corridor with a remote
  control, having it as a microphone and singing to the songs, and I used to think, &ldquo;if my dream of becoming a
  psychologist doesn&rsquo;t work out it would be really dope to make music&rdquo;. So I went back to the songs of my
  childhood, the songs of my parents, and I tried to recreate the storytelling and the emotions using my electronic
  approach to song-making, and that&rsquo;s where I am at right now, re-imagining music from both mine and my
  parents&rsquo; childhood using quite-modern production techniques.</p>

  <p><strong>True, you studied psychology. What happened to that?</strong></p>

  <p>Yes, I already wanted to be a psychologist when I was eight, and it&rsquo;s still very relevant in my daily life, but
  I like having two paths to pursue, and it&rsquo;s really nice when they mix together.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>When I started producing I went all the way back to the songs of my childhood, the songs of my parents</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>How often do you travel to Ghana?</strong></p>

  <p>About once a year. Sometimes I really miss home, and every time I go back I get some more added vitamins into my
  life. More stories, more sounds&hellip; There is always something new that I bring back with me; it&rsquo;s a really
  important part of my life.</p>

  <p><strong>It&rsquo;s easy to meet artists in Scandinavia who don&rsquo;t find this culture so inspiring, and yet at the
  same time certain influences can only happen here. What is it that you find here that contributes to your
  music?</strong></p>

  <p>There are many artists who are able to find a lot from here, but there&rsquo;s a reason why maybe their art is very
  minimal and sort of stripped to the bare minimum, both in music-making, arts, literature&hellip; You can say a lot with
  little, and that itself is an art form. When I&rsquo;m going back into this afrobeats music, afrojazz&hellip; there is
  nothing minimal about that &ndash; it&rsquo;s maximal, trying to fit in as many sounds as you possibly can. It&rsquo;s
  really nice to balance it, to have the maximal approach to putting in as many expressions as possible with a much more
  minimal, systematic way of doing things.</p>

  <p><strong>Your latest single, &ldquo;Out Of My League&rdquo;, came out last January. When did you write
  it?</strong></p>

  <p>I wrote it in 2017 while I was living in Troms&oslash;, all the way north, and I had made the production for it the
  previous year in Ghana; the contrast could not be bigger, and that is what makes the song so interesting for me. The
  song is part of an album based on events that I experienced once growing up in Ghana. In primary school I was super
  thin, I had this huge head and I was so shy. One of the scariest things was talking to girls; I grew up with four
  brothers and mostly my mom, so I had no references for when it came to that. The feeling was so real back then that I
  thought of making it into a song. The lyrics are loosely based on a passage from my favorite book in the Bible, Psalms
  of Solomon, which has some really beautiful texts.</p>

  <p><strong>The video for this song was shot in between Accra and Trondheim. I loved the shirt, by the way; it&rsquo;s
  exquisite.</strong></p>

  <p>I own a lot of shirts. My dad used to live in Italy in the nineties and have a ton of shirts from there; he never
  used them and a couple of years ago he gave them to me&hellip; I chose one for the shooting, which we did in Lokal Bar,
  in Trondheim, and Tripp Nie shot his part in Ghana.</p>

  <p><strong>What&rsquo;s your opinion about the way women are usually portrayed in music videos? I always wonder why a
  man needs so many women around to sing a song.</strong></p>

  <p>It sounds very hypocritical after this&nbsp;video has come out, but I am actually against it because I don&rsquo;t
  really pick up enough queues and it makes no sense to me. But it was my manager&#39;s vision and I trust&nbsp;him
  completely. Anyways, you&#39;re right, there are thousands of videos of one guy with eight girls around. It took a while
  to get the courage to film it and I don&rsquo;t think there are going to be many more videos of me like that; ironically
  that is the exact kind of situation the song is about. But there I was... I suppose in a way it&rsquo;s a very
  interesting irony.</p>

  <p><strong>Last year you released &ldquo;Silence (Things Fall Apart)&rdquo;, the first single off your upcoming album
  <em>Queensland</em>, in collaboration with Adomaa and M.anifest. How did you meet them?</strong></p>

  <p>Back in 2016 M.anifest was just about to release <em>Nowhere Cool</em>, which is one of my favorite albums ever,
  it&rsquo;s majestic. I sent his manager an email while I was thinking, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no chance that M.anifest is
  going to even see this&rdquo;. But then three days later I got a reply from his manager: &ldquo;hey, we heard the song.
  M.anifest likes it, he&rsquo;s gonna put a verse on it&rdquo;. A month later he was in the studio, recorded a couple of
  verses and the hook as well. &ldquo;Here you go&rdquo;. It was dope and it sounded amazing.</p>

  <p>I sent the song around to some friends in the music industry to get some feedback; a friend of mine from Denmark
  said, &ldquo;the song is great, the rap verses are fantastic, but you need a female vocalist&rdquo;. At the time I was
  speaking to a bunch of artists from Ghana; I had heard about Adomaa and I reached out to her manager. &ldquo;If
  M.anifest is on the song, we definitely want to be on the song&rdquo; &ndash; that&rsquo;s how M.anifest has helped me
  so much with this album. Adomaa recorded the hook and it all came together really nicely. Then I spent so much time
  mixing it, as I wanted it to sound afro poppy, but not too commercial; I wanted it to sound organic. That&rsquo;s the
  word. Finally I met the right mixing engineer, Poppa Lars, a god. He mixed it, it sounded perfect and then I knew we
  were done.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Queensland </em>will be your debut album, named after your school back in Accra. When is it coming
  out?</strong></p>

  <p>There are two versions of the plan. In the first one it comes out next April; the album is already uploaded, we are
  just one button away. However, a second plan surfed some weeks ago of perhaps making&nbsp;a third single with a huge
  artist from Ghana, and we are now in the negotiation process&hellip; We&rsquo;ve been working on the album for so many
  years and it&rsquo;s so good to release music again. The secret to the music industry, I found out, is that when you
  begin to release stuff that isn&rsquo;t bad, good things happen. I think sometimes artists fear that and they
  don&rsquo;t want to release music too soon because they don&rsquo;t want it to die and not live to what it can be. That
  is a real fear that I&rsquo;ve had for many years, but at the same time I was beginning to accept that even if a
  releasing dies quick, it will still live in a collection of other songs. If you googled my name now you would see
  &ldquo;Out Of My League&rdquo; and &ldquo;Silence&rdquo;, and suddenly you get much more of an idea of who I am and what
  I&rsquo;m trying to do.</p>

  <p><strong>Your brother, Gerald Ofori, is also an artist. Are there any other Oforis we must be aware of?</strong></p>

  <p>Gerald is two times cooler than I am, and he does really amazing quite hard-hitting&nbsp;but also really textured
  R&amp;B and hip hop music. He is only eighteen, he&rsquo;s been producing since he was eleven, and he began releasing
  his music when he was fifteen. We have played together before at Trondheim Calling Festival. You can be aware of every
  Ofori! My brother Gilbert was actually the first one to produce music in the family and he opened the door for both
  Gerald and me.</p>

  <p><strong>Right now you live in Oslo, but do you see yourself moving to any other city that you find inspiring for your
  music?</strong></p>

  <p>I think I could. I&rsquo;m really happy at Oslo right now and I will probably stay here for a while, but it would be
  good to have a year in Copenhagen or London, or to spend some months in the States, living down south or by the coast,
  having fresh air and the chance to walk and write. But all of those would be short, project-based periods because the
  first album is done, the second album is in my head and in the computer, and the third album is also already happening.
  It would be cool to have a period of four months to work exclusively on the third album.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The secret to the music industry, I found out, is that when you begin to release stuff that isn&rsquo;t bad, good
  things happen</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>Besides your own music you have also produced for other artists, like Kwesi Arthur or M.anifest. Who will you
  be working with next?</strong></p>

  <p>The biggest compliment I can get is that others want my production under their work. It&rsquo;s dope. Now I&rsquo;m
  working on an EP for Tripp Nie, and I&rsquo;m trying to set up a working relationship with British-Ghanaian rapper
  Bryte. I&rsquo;ve produced some stuff for an EP that he&rsquo;s making and I think we can do something really cool
  together. I&rsquo;m mostly trying to look out for new artists from West Africa who are coming with different inputs and
  have a good plan.</p>

  <p><strong>Last January, you participated in the 10th edition of Trondheim Calling Festival. In which other events will
  we see you this year?</strong></p>

  <p>I definitely have many plans for this year. We will play at Bl&aring; in Oslo, and I&rsquo;m trying to set up a
  residence in Khartoum, also in Oslo. I&rsquo;m angling for two festivals after the summer that I&rsquo;m hoping to play.
  I&rsquo;m hoping that Trondheim Calling has unlocked the door to many more gigs; we are now a more or less functioning
  band, who would&rsquo;ve thought that would ever happen? But it&rsquo;s actually happening, and my manager is working
  his socks off trying to put more stuff together.</p>

  <p><strong>A last piece of advice from George?</strong></p>

  <p>If anyone is out there making music or trying to figure out what they want to sound like, sounding like yourself is
  the best possible thing. I spent a lot of years trying to find out what I wanted to sound like, and it was so nice to
  realize that sounding like me meant sounding like a Ghanaian. Not just a person from West Africa, but also someone who
  has been influenced by all those different experiences and contrasts. Finding out who I am and what is important to me,
  and then making music that sounds like that has been the key.</p>

The crisp and fresh
  sprouts are an enormous boost to your diet, especially during winter time.</p>

  <p>And once winter goes and spring, summer and autumn follow, you can keep using sprouts in salads, as another sandwich
  layer or loosely sprinkled over a hot (or cold) soup.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Sprouts: Buy or grow?</strong></p>

  <p>There is usually a big variety of lovely sprouts in almost all health food stores. Most likely you find them in the
  entrance area in a small refrigerated counter. From there they can find their way easily and straight to your plate at
  home.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>To shoot sprouts is not rocket science!</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But I would like to encourage you to grow your own sprouts. To shoot sprouts is not rocket science! You neither need
  a garden nor a lot of space at home or plenty of time. It takes two to five days for the first harvest to come in and
  when you follow some few rules you will have a great grocery always on hand all year long &ndash; and it comes with a
  high nutrient level.</p>

  <p><strong>Fresh to the max</strong></p>

  <p>The biggest advantage of growing your own sprouts is the incredible freshness of your produce. Freshly harvested,
  they are king of crisp and can easily become part of your meal within seconds. That is where all stores loose
  out.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>On top of that, you save packaging, it is much cheaper and you can be sure that no fertilizer or chemical substances
  were used during the growth process.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>A win, win, win situation I would say!</p>

  <p>Requirements for growing your sprouts</p>

  <p>Healthy seeds from controlled biological cultivation (best to get from an organic food store)</p>

  <p>Rule of thumb is that 1-2 tablespoons of seeds are enough to start as the sprouts double, triple or quintuple their
  volume when they grow. Keeps this in mind to guarantee enough oxygen supply.</p>

  <p>A light spot in a room, but without direct sunlight. Sprouts love indirect lighting, some even prefer it dark.</p>

  <p>Water sprouts 2-4 times a day. Sprouts need sufficient moisture to shoot but should never be soaked in water.</p>

  <p>The seeds need enough oxygen, so do not put them in a sealed glass container.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Should you use a glass, a bowl or something else to grow your sprouts?</p>

  <p>You will find plenty of supply in retail stores to make your sprout growing easier. Good equipment will also help you
  to grow more types of sprouts at the same time.</p>

  <p>Special growing devices are sold often in organic health stores or in a good retail stores.</p>

  <p>I like my growing glasses von&nbsp;Eschfelder&nbsp;a lot. They look good, are easy to clean and the integrated
  strainer makes watering the sprouts walk of cake.&nbsp; Just put them in your dish rack, that way the water can flow out
  and your sprouts will be moist but not wet.</p>

  <p>If you want to give it a try, you can use a marmalade glass, a water-permeable piece of cloth and a rubber band to
  build your own growing glass. Once you got the hang of growing sprouts, it is worth to invest in a bit more solid
  growing glasses</p>

  <p><strong>Growing sprouts step by step</strong></p>

  <p>First step:&nbsp;Water the seeds</p>

  <p>Wash your seeds with running water and put them into a glass container. Cover them with sufficient water and let them
  soak for 4 to 12 hours. Some seeds gain a lot of volume during that time, so make sure that there is always enough water
  to keep them soaked. 1-2 tablespoons of seeds should be enough given the large increase in volume.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Second step:&nbsp;Pour the water and sort the badlings out</p>

  <p>When soaking time is over, pour out the water in the container (use it to water your plants!) and sort out seedlings
  that did not shoot. Also, get rid of little seed shells. All that cannot shoot anymore needs to be removed from the
  container otherwise it starts to rot in the moist environment. Once you are done, clean the seeds again under running
  water and put them back into the container.</p>

  <p>Put the container with the strainer lid closed in your dish rack, or use a strainer to drip-dry the seeds (in case
  you do not have a strainer lid) and put it in a light place without direct sun light.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Third step:&nbsp;Let the seeds grow and water them&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Depending on the type of sprouts, you let them grow from two to five days. It is paramount, that you water them 2-4
  times a day during that period and put them do drip-dry in the dish rack afterwards. Remember that they like moist but
  not wet. Keep them moist at all times, otherwise they will dry up. Don&rsquo;t keep them too wet, or they will rot.
  Adequate care and sanitary work is key here.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Fourth step:&nbsp;Harvest time and eating pleasure</p>

  <p>After 2-5 days (depending on the type) the sprouts are ready for consumption. The best thing is to eat them fresh but
  if needed you can keep them for up to three days in your fridge.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>What is the matter when the seeds don&rsquo;t shoot?</p>

  <p>It can happen that the seeds do not shoot. A couple of things might be the reason for that:</p>

  <p>Old seeds that have been stored inadequately will shoot less or not at all.</p>

  <p>If the water hasn&rsquo;t dripped out enough and the seeds start to smell moldy or start to rot, dispose them at
  once.</p>

  <p>Lack of oxygen can also lead to rotting. Most of the times there are too many seeds in a container (remember the
  increase in volume!)</p>

  <p>Direct sunlight also pushes rotting. The sprouts get weak and collapse. During hot temperatures in summer, water once
  or twice times more per day.</p>

  <p>If your sprouts or seeds dry up you need to water and dry-drip them more often</p>

  <p>Sprouts as raw food or blanched?</p>

  <p>I like to eat my sprouts raw. But folks with a weakened immune system, toddlers, golden ager and pregnant women

  <p>Wash and peel the sweet potato. Cut into cubes as small as possible.</p>

  <p>Core the chilli and add</p>

  <p>Finely chop the peeled garlic and onion.</p>

  <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in a pan.</p>

  <p>Braise the chilli, onion and garlic briefly.</p>

  <p>Add the sweet potato cubes.</p>

  <p>Notes</p>

  <p>Depending on your wishes, briefly fry in a little sesame oil. Dumplings can be prepared very well. Just keep them in

  flavour.</p>

  <p>Serves 4</p>

  <p>Ingredients:</p>

  <p>Pasta dough:</p>

  <p>200g &lsquo;00&rsquo; pasta flour, plus extra for dusting</p>

  <p>200g fine semolina</p>

  <p>4 eggs</p>

  <p>Roast Squash Filling:</p>

  <p>1 butternut squash</p>

  <p>2 garlic cloves, lightly bashed</p>

  <p>Sea salt</p>

  <p>Olive oil</p>

  <p>100g ricotta</p>

  <p>Salt, pepper to taste</p>

  <p>50g roasted chestnuts</p>

  <p>350ml double cream</p>

  <p>200g parmesan, finely grated</p>

  <p>1 bay leaf</p>

  <p>Nutmeg, finely grated</p>

  <p>5 sage leaves</p>

  <p>2 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>To make the pasta, lightly whisk the eggs together. Place the flour in a food processor and slowly drizzle in the
  eggs while running until a dough forms.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, you make the pasta traditionally by hand by placing the flour on a work surface and creating a well in
  the middle. Crack the eggs into the well and use your fingers to gradually work the eggs together dragging the flour in
  from the side. You may not need to use all the flour as it begins to form a ball.</p>

  <p>Use your hands to bring the dough together and knead for 5 minutes until it becomes shiny and elastic but not too
  tacky. Wrap in clingfilm and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.</p>

  <p>Preheat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 6.</p>

  <p>Peel the butternut squash roughly chop into chunks, discarding the seeds. Place in a roasting tray with the salt,
  garlic and toss with the olive oil.</p>

  <p>Roast in the oven for 30 minutes until soft. A cutlery knife should easily pierce through. Set aside to cool.</p>

  <p>Remove the roasted garlic cloves from their skins and blitz with the squash in a food processor. Add the ricotta and
  a drizzle of olive oil, pulsing until smooth. Pass the squash through a sieve to leave a smooth puree. Taste and season
  with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p>Cut a quarter of the pasta dough and generously sprinkle over some flour. Roll out on a pasta machine on the widest
  setting. Fold the pasta over and pass again through the machine. Repeat the rolling process to the penultimate setting
  until you have sheets of pasta. Lay them out on a lightly floured tray covered with a tea towel to stop them from drying
  out.</p>

  <p>Transfer the squash filling in a piping bag or spoon a tsp of the filling across the long edge of the pasta sheet,
  10cm apart. Cut out equal squares with the filling in the center. Lightly brush the border of each square with a damp
  finger, then fold over the opposite corners to touch and press together. Try to expel out as much air as possible with
  your fingers before gently squeezing the edges together to form a triangle. Bring the two outer corners of the triangle
  together and press together to form a tortellini shape. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Place the tortellini on a floured tray covered with a tea towel, while you fold the rest. Leave the covered tray in
  the fridge if waiting a while before cooking.</p>

  <p>Lightly blitz the roasted chestnuts in a food processor to break up to a crumb.</p>

  <p>In a small frying pan, heat the olive oil until very hot but not smoking. Carefully add the sage leaves and fry until
  crisp. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer to a tray lined with paper to drain.</p>

  <p>Bring the double cream to a simmer with the bay leaf and nutmeg. Take the pan off the heat and add the parmesan,
  mixing to melt in until smooth. Set aside until serving.</p>

  <p>When ready to cook, place a large pan of salted water on to boil. Cook the tortellini for 2-3 minutes or until al
  dente &ndash; use one as a tester to check if it&rsquo;s cooked.</p>

  <p>Gently reheat the brown butter and the parmesan cream to serve, garnished with the crispy sage leaves and chestnut
  crumb.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking-recipes/butternut-squash-and-sage-tortellini-parmesan-veloute-and-chestnut-crumb</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking-recipes/butternut-squash-and-sage-tortellini-parmesan-veloute-and-chestnut-crumb</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Recipes]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2020 14:18:13 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Holly Farrier, Talia Yilmaz</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pear, Caramelised Onion and Blue Cheese Galette]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>The amazing thing with Gallette's are that they can be filled with many great flavors. This is one of our
  favourites</p>

  <p>Serves 6</p>

  <p>250g plain flour</p>

  <p>Pinch of salt</p>

  <p>125g unsalted butter, chilled and diced</p>

  <p>1 tbsp water</p>

  <p>1 egg yolk, to glaze</p>

  <p>1 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p>20g butter</p>

  <p>4 red onions, finely sliced</p>

  <p>1 tbsp sherry vinegar</p>

  <p>2 tbsp brown sugar</p>

  <p>5 pears, peeled, cored and sliced vertically</p>

  <p>150g blue cheese, such as roquefort</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>Begin with the pastry. In a food processor, blitz the flour and chilled cubes of butter until it resembles fine
  breadcrumbs. Add the water and pulse briefly as big flakes of dough form and it comes into a ball. Take out the dough
  and gently bring it together, kneading gently into a flat disc. Press out any cracks and wrap in cling film to chill in
  the fridge for 15 minutes.</p>

  <p>Heat the olive oil and butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onions with a good pinch of
  salt, then reduce the heat to sweat them down until really soft and translucent, about 25 minutes. Cover and stir from
  time to time to stop them from sticking.</p>

  <p>When the onions have completely softened, add the sugar and sherry vinegar. Turn up the heat to medium and cook for 5
  minutes uncovered, until they take on a deep caramel color and any liquid has evaporated. Transfer the onions into a
  bowl to cool.</p>

  <p>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 6.</p>

  <p>Take the dough out of the fridge and roll it out to a large circle between two sheets of baking parchment (about 35cm
  diameter, 3mm thick). Remove the top layer of parchment and press any cracks together. Trim around the edge to neaten it
  up to an even circle (it&rsquo;s ok if it looks really rustic!). Transfer the sheet of paper with pastry onto a baking
  tray.</p>

  <p>Spread the caramelized onion mixture over the pastry, leaving a 5cm border around the edge. Arrange the sliced pears
  over the top of the onions and generously crumble over the blue cheese.</p>

  <p>Lightly whisk the egg yolk and brush all over the rim of the pastry.</p>

  <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 mins until the pastry is golden and cooked through. Leave for a few minutes to
  stand before slicing and eating warm.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/pear-caramelised-onion-and-blue-cheese-galette</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/pear-caramelised-onion-and-blue-cheese-galette</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2020 14:00:15 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Holly Farrier, Talia Yilmaz</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pagani Huayra — A Work of Art on Wheels]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>If money is not an issue and you want to drive the most exclusive Italian car that money can buy, Pagani Huayra is
  the answer!</p>

  <p>If you thought Ferrari and Lamborghini were the most exclusive car brands from Emilia-Romagna, or Motor Valley as the
  area is called, you would be wrong. Just around the corner from those factories is Pagani Automobile, with other brands
  like Maserati and previously also deTomaso and Bugatti inhabiting the area.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Pagani certainly doesn&rsquo;t release new models each and every day like some other brands</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The company was founded by Argentinian Horacio Pagani, sharing his nationality with Alejandro de Tomaso. Pagani
  studied design as well as mechanical engineering in Argentina, designing a Formula 2 car as well as receiving
  scholarships from London and Pasadena before moving to Italy in 1983. One year later, he designed the Countach
  Evoluzione which was the first car with a carbon fiber chassis and subsequently got involved in the design of the
  Countach Anniversary and the Diablo. The Foundation of Modena Design, later to be known as Pagani Automobili, was
  founded in 1991 and its first car, the Pagani Zonda C12, was launched in 1999.</p>

  <p>Pagani certainly doesn&rsquo;t release models each and every day like some other brands do. The Huayra, pronounced
  &#39;H-wire-ah&#39; like the South American wind god Huayra Tata, was the second model to be released, introduced in
  2012. So, what happened in-between? Well, instead of making new models, Pagani has focused on different versions of the
  contemporary model. The Zonda came in a plethora of versions - F, Cinque, Tricolore, and Revolution to name a few.</p>

  <p>The Huayra is too young to have that many versions, but a roadster version and the add-on BC exists. The latter is
  more adapted to the racetrack, with more aerodynamic details and a big spoiler in the back. There is also a
  super-exclusive special version of the Huayra named after Imola, the famous racing track in Italy. The car has been made
  specifically for car collector Oleg Egotov, who is the founder of the car styling company TopCar Design. Rumor has it
  five copies of the Imola will be produced.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The heart of the Huayra is a 700 hp 6-liter twin-turbo V12 engine from German AMG, the same company that refines and
  produces the sportiest models for Mercedes. You might think that a car with a price tag of almost ten million SEK would
  have a proprietary engine, but the benefits of using a well-developed engine from German AMG include increased
  operational security and service availability.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Pagani have never been very focused on performance metrics or breaking speed records</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The car is equipped with a classic 7-Speed sequential automatic transmission to handle the massive torque of 1000 Nm.
  Since pretty much the whole car is made of carbon fiber, the weight has been greatly reduced. The Huyara weighs in at a
  neat 1350 kilos and the weight distribution is 44% on the front axis and 56% on the back axis.</p>

  <p>What distinguishes Pagani from companies like Koenigsegg is that they have never been focused on performance
  metrics&nbsp;or breaking speed records. That being said, the Huayra will still do 0-100 in under 3.5 seconds and reach a
  top speed of just under 400 km/h. And even though the numbers are not the most important part of a Pagani Huayra, that
  doesn&rsquo;t make it any less interesting. A Pagani should be considered a work of art rather than a car to break
  records in.</p>

  <p>Every detail is beautiful enough to display at an art museum, and you could spend an eternity just admiring the
  craftsmanship behind it. Nothing has been left to chance or mindlessly placed in the car. The incredibly beautiful,
  clear-lacquered, carbon fiber rear-view mirrors. The open, skeleton-like design for the transmission. The cluster of
  buttons and levers surrounding the steering wheel, making it look like a beautifully constructed aluminum aircraft. It
  all comes together in a masterpiece you could stare at forever.</p>

  <p>The feeling of driving a Pagani is obviously as exciting as looking at it parked. The car comes alive in a way other
  cars can only dream of. To say that a Pagani is a comfortable car, however, is a false statement. You can hear
  everything, most of all the sound of the V12 engine behind your back, but also the mechanical noise of engaging each
  gear. Despite the tremendous power from the engine, this car can be controlled relatively well. I say relatively because
  in order to dare to explore the boundaries of this car, you have to be used to driving this type of car, and few people
  actually are. Especially not those who would actually buy, or rather invest in, a Pagani. The cars have steadily
  increased in value and in some cases the factory has actually bought back single versions to display in the museum
  adjacent to the factory, which is well worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area. This is the one place a mere mortal
  could get a chance to even get close to a Pagani Huayra, because the chance of seeing it on your neighborhood street is
  unfortunately minimal.</p>

Take Care of Your Body]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Often times, sports articles describe workouts that will help improve your performance, but true change of habit will
  only happen if we understand the “why” behind the actions we take.</p>

  <p>Imagine being 47 years old and earning the nickname &ldquo;The Machine&rdquo; over the course of a three-day weekend
  in Colorado. Now imagine earning that nickname from your athletic, high school-aged son. Sean Grossman recently
  experienced this, and you can imagine the pride conveyed as he recounted the weekend.</p>

  <p>Maybe you won&rsquo;t be skipping lunch in the lodge and storing sandwiches in your ski pants like Sean, but it
  wasn&rsquo;t the skipping of lunch that earned him the nickname. It was the endurance and strength that allowed him to
  ski all day long for three full days that earned him the nickname. It was waking up fresh and ready to go each morning
  while the others were dragging. This is no happenstance; Sean has been resistance training twice a week religiously for
  over two years, mixing in cardio and mobility work on his own time, and paying attention to what he is putting in his
  body.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>You&rsquo;re sitting at your&nbsp;desk on Monday morning with sore legs, and you think that maybe taking the kids
  on that ski trip wasn&rsquo;t the greatest idea</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is no natural born talent to point to here, only hard work and discipline. And that discipline has paid off in
  his ability to squeeze the absolute most out of every day on the mountain. If he is ever limited, it is by his technical
  ability, never his level of fitness. I would know - I&rsquo;ve been training him for over 2 years in New York City.</p>

  <p>Now try to imagine a ski trip with the family or some friends where your legs aren&rsquo;t burning on the mountain
  all day long. Instead of thinking about how badly you want to take your boots and skis off and take a seat, you&rsquo;re
  figuring out which run you&rsquo;re going to crush next. When Sunday comes after a full day of skiing on Saturday,
  instead of being sore and stiff, you&rsquo;re fresh and ready to go. You&rsquo;re not looking into the future, towards
  relief and the sofa. Instead, you&rsquo;ve gained the ability to be present in the moment, something that has become
  harder and harder to do.</p>

  <p>In his book &ldquo;The Miracle of Mindfulness&rdquo;, Thich Nhat Hanh talks about washing the dishes in a very
  profound way; he proposes the idea that one must wash the dishes solely for the sake of washing the dishes. My
  brother-in-law and I always joke around with this saying, but there is real depth to it. If you aren&rsquo;t present in
  your dishwashing and in the here and now, and instead are thinking about that cup of coffee or movie you&rsquo;re going
  to watch later, what makes you think that when you finally reach your cup of coffee or movie that you won&rsquo;t be
  then thinking about what is next?</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Maybe it&rsquo;s your mindset that really needs to shift</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>How is this related to fitness and skiing? A&nbsp;lack of strength and endurance can strongly affect not only the way
  that you experience the immediacy of skiing itself, but also the way you build a memory of that experience. You
  can&rsquo;t just wish or think away quadriceps muscles that feel like they are on fire.</p>

  <p>That sensation, along with the feeling of fatigue takes up a certain amount of your mind in the present. They take
  away from the potential joy of the activity and fill it with bits of discomfort. And then, in the aftermath,
  you&rsquo;re sitting at your desk or computer on Monday morning and your legs are so sore that you think that maybe
  taking the kids on that ski trip wasn&rsquo;t the greatest idea. Would that change your attitude about going on
  adventure or ski-based trips in the future?</p>

  <p>The last three years of my life have been spent working as a personal trainer, where time and time again it has been
  made clear that our clients must understand the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind what they are doing in order for a true buy-in
  to occur and new habits to take root. Without establishing the &ldquo;why&rdquo;, without that buy-in, the motivation to
  stick to a program and continue making time for exercise is no doubt going to fade. So it&rsquo;s important for all of
  us to really understand what it means to be a healthier, stronger version of ourselves, and what that can open up for us
  in terms of experiences.</p>

  <p>What drew me into personal training in the first place was the freedom in life to try new things, due to being a
  lifelong athlete. There was never an activity I couldn&rsquo;t participate in. This gave and still gives me a true sense
  of physical freedom. Working with my clients to help them reach that point in their own lives has been extremely
  rewarding. For many of them, the lack of fitness has limited them at one time or another from taking part in a life
  experience with loved ones or friends.</p>

  <p>These positive and new experiences are part of the foundation that a fulfilling life is built on. When you look at
  exercise from this perspective and see a strong, healthy body as a key that can be used to open doors to life&#39;s
  physical experience, the concept of working out becomes a lot less daunting. There is meaning behind it. It is no longer
  cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

  <p>A lot of information we consume regarding fitness and how it can improve our skiing performance can be placed into a
  small number of categories: what exercises you could benefit most from, which new stretches to add to your workouts, or
  how to change your training style to make you more durable and prepared for the season ahead. But maybe it&rsquo;s your
  mindset that really needs to shift. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to dig deep and ask ourselves what it would mean to us to
  experience skiing and all the other physical challenges in life in a different light. We all have the potential to
  become our own version of &ldquo;The Machine&rdquo;, we just need to shift our perspective, take ownership of our daily
  choices, and watch the beauty that ensues.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/health-fitness/want-have-more-fun-skiing-take-care-your-body</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/health-fitness/want-have-more-fun-skiing-take-care-your-body</guid><category><![CDATA[Health & Fitness]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 10:00:48 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Tony Ponte</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Christmas Strudel]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>A fun idea to enjoy this Christmas… It looks good, and tastes even better!</p>

  smooth apricot jam for brushing<br />
  115 g of granadilla pulp (small can)<br />
  icing sugar to sprinkle</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C.</p>

  <p>Place the apples in a pan with the butter and sugar, and cook until soft and golden, for about 15 minutes. Allow it
  to cool.</p>

  <p>Place the cooled apple mixture in a bowl together with the Christmas mincemeat, cherries, pecans, almonds, zest and
  juice, as well as half the breadcrumbs, and stir well to combine.</p>

  <p>Arrange a clean tea towel on a suitable surface, sprinkle with flour and then layer a sheet of phyllo on top.</p>

  <p>Brush the phyllo with butter and repeat with the remaining phyllo.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Sprinkle the remaining breadcrumbs and the ground almonds evenly over the top of the final sheet of buttered
  phyllo.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Spread the fruit and nut filling on the pastry, leaving a 3 cm border all around.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Fold the borders on the long sides in over the filling, and start rolling up the pastry by turning in the border
  along the short edge nearest to you. Then keep rolling, lifting up the tea towel to help form the roll.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Reduce the oven temperature to 190&deg;C.</p>

  <p>Before completing the roll, lift the far edge of the tea towel over a paper-lined baking tray. Finish rolling the
  strudel carefully onto the tray, ending with its seam&nbsp;side down.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Brush all over with more melted butter and sprinkle with flaked almonds. Bake until crisp and golden, about 30 to 35
  minutes.</p>

  <p>Thin the jam with a little water and warm it slightly in the microwave, together with the granadilla pulp.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Remove the strudel from the oven.&nbsp;Drizzle generously with the warm jam and granadilla mixture, and dredge with
  icing sugar.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Sprinkle with the remaining roasted almond flakes.&nbsp; Serve warm with pouring cream, a dollop of full cream
  yogurt, or a scoop of ice cream.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/christmas-strudel</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/christmas-strudel</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 15:00:01 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Sophia Lindop, Hein van Tonder</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Skiing down the world's three highest mountains]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>The adventure photographer Fredrik Schenholm got extreme skier Tormod Granheim to climb mountains after the triumph
  and tragedy of Mount Everest.</p>

  <p>It was the best day of my life. For four years I had prepared myself by climbing some of the highest mountains in the
  world and skiing down for some of the world&#39;s steepest mountainsides. I&#39;m having trouble looking forward to the
  adventure because it was also the worst day of my life.</p>

  <p>After climbing continuously for 24 hours from the camp, 6400 meters above sea level, as a climber at the Advanced
  Base Camp, I stood with the skis on my feet, on top of Mount Everest - the world&#39;s highest mountain.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, Tomas Olsson broke one skid and shortly afterward, he fell, unleashed from the mountain. I was alone
  8500 meters above sea level. My oxygen mask was broken, most of our climbing equipment disappeared with Tomas, including
  one of my ice-axes, who had been part of the firing tank. The answerable silence when I pushed the push-to-talk button
  cut my heart. From the north pass of 7100 meters, I could later hear photographer Fredrik Schenholm, who scanned the
  mountainside through his 400-millimeter lens.</p>

  <p><em>&mdash;Tormod, where is Tomas?</em></p>

  <p>Afraid of my own feelings, I pressed the button and replied:</p>

  <p><em>&mdash;I do not know</em> &mdash;but I was afraid that all hope was out for Tomas.</p>

  <p>Hunting pilots call it &ldquo;Helmet Fire&rdquo;&nbsp;when the pressure around them becomes too intense. When they
  are no longer able to observe, orientate, decide and perform - the constant decision-making process that is a
  prerequisite for performing in demanding environments.</p>

  <p>My own mantra I had learned from back hopper Lasse Ottesen, I focused on one thing: the tasks. To stand in the middle
  of the skis, no matter what happened around me. Whatever the surface. The situation was critical. Only my own focused
  decisions could surely take me down the mountain.</p>

  <p>Over 2000 climbers had climbed Everest before Tomas and me. But only about 50 people had climbed to the top via a
  route other than the normal roads, more known as the Hillarymember from the Nepalese side or the Malloryleden from the
  Tibetan side. At a height of 8700 meters, in height of &ldquo;The Third Step&rdquo;, which is the least demanding part
  of Malloryleden, that is, more than 100 meters above the top of K2, we had turned left into a series of shelves that we
  dubbed during our planning to the balcony.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>We were now heading for a joint that had just been climbed by a handful of people throughout the ages</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>One of them was Reinhold Messner, who became the first person who climbed Mount Everest himself in 1980, a
  performance he performed without oxygen for a 4-day period. This was the entrance to the big ravine as a climber called
  Norton Couloiren, one of the few places on the mountain that has plenty of snow for skiing. The couloir crosses a part
  of the 3000m high north wall. The average slope is 55 degrees.</p>

  <p>The crossing over the balcony filled me with joy, but also respect. The top of the mountain was never our true goal.
  In reality, it was the beginning of our real challenge. Underneath my steel edges, a steep convex mountain side
  disappeared. The knowledge that this steep mountain did not tolerate any mistakes had existed since I, on a January day
  four years ago, said yes to this challenge.</p>

  <p>I stood alongside Tomas at the foot of the Polish glacier on the 6962-meter high mountain Aconcagua after a
  successful run-down of America&#39;s highest mountain.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>We can climb high mountains, we can drive downhill on skis. Should we drive the north side of Everest?</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo;, was all I could answer. It has not been done with skiing before. From the highest mountain in the
  world. Via a line that many of the world&#39;s best mountain skiers had tried without success. We do it step by step, we
  use the preparations for the coming years, by gradually climbing higher mountains and skiing steeper mountainsides.</p>

  <p>It seems so logical. So simple. I said yes. Without knowing, I was now a member of an exclusive club. Only 5% of all
  people on earth have a plan that spans five years into the future. Long-term goals provide greater dividends of life.
  Respect for the mountains has always been a part of me. Over the years, from the time we decided to go to Everest, it
  was clear that Tomas had the same respect.</p>

  <p>High altitude climb is about being proactive. It&#39;s about drinking before you&#39;re thirsty, dress up before you
  get too cold and understand the weather so you can turn before the storm catches you high up on the mountain. A bit
  beneath the balcony, one of Tomas&#39;s ski breaks. I think this brought us into a reactive phase. We lost control.</p>

  <p>Messner, one of the world&#39;s best climbers, took one and a half days from the top down to the foot of the
  mountain. We had six hours at us. We had no privacy equipment with us. We were forced to reach a campsite before sunset.
  Our most important resource was speed. But if Tomas could not go skiing then we were out of speed. To try to return to
  Malloryleden in a snowy snow would probably require more of us than to continue down. Only movement could save us from
  what was developing into a disaster.</p>

  <p>Below we have a 15-meter high vertical cliff and it is on top of this as we pick up a rope and make a firing anchor
  in the snow. Ideally, we had made the anchor in mountain or ice, but in the few cracks, we found the mountain smashed
  and there was no ice in this cold, dry climate. Without a continuous movement toward our campsite we would die a cold
  death when the combination of oxygen mist, dehydration and cold became too much for our bodies.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>With the skis on my backpack, I climbed down 15-20 meters before I could start skiing again. Gradually the snow cover
  became thinner and gray glacier ice clearer. On sharp steel edges, I made big turns on the changing surface. The spinal
  cord ruled the skis, which should always remain on the steel edges if the control was to be maintained. Many turns
  scratched the hard gray ice.</p>

  <p>Every time I looked over the shoulders of slough management, I could see the dark track over me in my eyes. With the
  weight in the middle of the skis, I was looking for my friend, but all I found were traces of his case that showed where
  he had accelerated down the mountainside. When I arrived at his Ice-axe it was obvious to take it from the mountain. The
  Ice-axe is a climber&#39;s most personal equipment.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>I was unsure if we&#39;ll ever see Tomas again</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I put ice-protection on my backpack and crossed right into the north-pass. There I met Fredrik and the two sherpas
  who had followed to shoot us high up on the mountain. I felt 50 years older and hugely tired. We found Tomas four days
  later. Probably he died before the fall was stopped, 1700 meters below the firing tank where we stood together.</p>

  <p>Fredrik continued with his geology studies in Gothenburg, I went to Oslo where I wrote a book about Everest and the
  time that led to the unfortunate day when Tomas and I reached the top. It took a long time to process the experiences on
  the mountain and the fact that I and Tomas would never go skiing again.</p>

  <p>But time passed and I melted the experiences and began to philosophize what it takes to perform at a high level in
  demanding circumstances. In early 2008, Fredrik asked if I would like to come to Iceland. He would travel and photograph
  on the island of the North Atlantic and needed someone who could write a text to the pictures.</p>

  <p>The encounter with the island was a mighty experience. Skiing is not a common activity in this windy country between
  Europe and Greenland, where condensed and boiling water projects from the interior of the earth. We were on volcanic
  land and Fredrik got an idea: he suggested that during the winter we visit some of the world&#39;s most active
  volcanoes.</p>

  <p>This would also lead to a bit of fun - during the project, I would go skiing down the world&#39;s top three
  mountains. The top of Mount Everest is as everyone knows at the top of the sea, 8850 meters. But from a geological
  perspective, there are more reference points.</p>

  <p>The brakes scream two hours south of Ecuador&#39;s capital, Quito. The express buses brake and stop, we jump off at
  the same moment. Soon we have our two big backpacks and the ski bag that separates us from all other travelers in this
  country. The accelerating bus disappears in a cloud of cheap, badly burned diesel. We are in the middle of the part of
  the Andes called Vulkan Avenue.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>As soon as the luggage door is closed, the driver will hit the gas</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We have been in Ecuador for some time, gradually we have climbed higher and higher. Now we are heading for the&nbsp;5
  897 meters high Cotopaxi volcano to end the acclimatization ahead of our attempt at Chimborazo, the world&#39;s highest
  mountain, measured from the core of the earth.</p>

  <p>Because of the rotation of the earth, the globe is not perfect around, but rather elliptical. The circumference is
  greatest at the equator. This means that Chimborazo, which is only a latitude south of the equator, is 2 168 meters
  closer to the stars than Mount Everest. Chimborazo is located 6 384 kilometers from the center of the earth.</p>

  <p>We reach the peak just after the sunrise. Enormous amounts of moisture that have been condensed during the night wake
  up and iron the mountain in the form of a veiled mist. The view is bad. Fredrik and I are standing on top. We want to
  see the 300-meter wide crater that is hidden in the fog. We will be standing on top, waiving.</p>

  <p>I got a little closer, until a little hill just before the edge of the deep crater. At the same moment, the fog
  lightens a bit, and I hear Fredrik shout:</p>

  <p><em>&mdash;Kolla, volcanic eruption!</em></p>

  <p>At first, I look into Cotopaxi&#39;s interior but see nothing. Lucky, I think. But Fredrik points to the horizon, and
  thereupon rises a huge ash pillar several miles up to the sky:</p>

  <p><em>&mdash;It&#39;s Tungurahua! It has eruptions!</em></p>

  <p>Behind us we see Chimborazo, and on the left a several kilometers high ashtrays that protrude from Tungurahua, one of
  the world&#39;s most active volcanoes. I hear how the shutter in Fredrik&#39;s camera gets to work, but as suddenly as
  he caught sight of the outbreak, it&#39;s gone, hidden in the impenetrable fog. It is time to put on the skis and head
  down.</p>

  <p>The downhill skiing offers about 1000 altitude meters in relatively steep terrain, mostly on a permanent glacier that
  covers the top. Skiing is steep enough to be demanding, but really hard it&#39;s never. We travel to the resort Banos
  located in the shadow of Tungurahua.</p>

  <p>A few years ago, the whole village was evacuated when Tungurahua had a series of outbreaks, but now it&#39;s every
  day in the city that got its name of all the hot springs you can visit. After two days we will go to Chimborazo. A taxi
  takes us up to 4 800 meters altitude where we set up our tent under the stars.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The resort is well aware of the danger of the volcano and the people are well informed about the evacuation
  plans</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A few hours later, with steeples under the pants and the skis on the backpack, the climb begins to rise. The trail
  traverses on a back that leads towards the top. When I reach my back, I feel the wind meets me with enormous power.
  I&#39;m well before Fredrik, who struggles with one of the biggest problems climbers often experiences: the stomach.</p>

  <p>I walk down a few meters, read from the wind, and await Fredrik. We agree that each one keeps his own pace towards
  the top. I feel that the shape is good, two hours later I take over the last crown, just to realize that the map has
  already shown that the real peak is almost a kilometer away. A wide back separates me from the real peak.</p>

  <p>The tracks from other climbers who visited the mountain stop here. I trace myself in the hoarfrost at almost 6 300
  meters altitude. I miss the Mp3 player. When I reach the top and can take a look at the other side, I see that even
  today, Tungurahua is shooting a large ash pillar up to the sky. I think of the geologist Fredrik. He must see this.
  I&#39;m getting the radio.</p>

  <p><em>&mdash;Fredrik, hurry up to the top. You must see this, it is absolutely amazing!</em></p>

  <p>The order is running out of me, but I do not get an answer. The big crush between us has placed Fredrik in radio
  shadow. Soon I see him, I go down a little from the top to give some encouragement. Together we go to the top and at the
  same time, a new ash pillar shoots against the sky, this time from the Sangay volcano.</p>

  <p>Fredrik gets new energy from all the volcanic activity, the atmosphere at the top is amazing. We stand together and
  look at the outbreaks that quickly build up large ash clouds in the sky. The ash from the volcanoes blends with the
  white moisture of the clouds and a gray light veil disappears south. It&#39;s time for skiing.</p>

  <p>The skiing downhill is not easy. Sun and cold have packed the mountain in hard crowds, sometimes it&#39;s hardly
  snowing, and sometimes the skis breakthrough. The lower part offers summer nights, the sun sets on and makes the snow
  warm and soft. I pin on to prevent melting seracs and ice cubes from falling into my head. Below is a tight cloud cover.
  We are skiing down the sky.</p>

  <p>A plume of steam shoots towards the sky. From the inside of the earth melted stone - lava, right into the sea. We are
  on Hawaii&#39;s Big Island. Stelnad lava has blocked the road we came driving on, the car is parked and we starve
  fascinated by the view in front of us. Was this the island of Hawaii becoming? Yes, but not just that.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Thanks to the volcanoes we have our unique atmosphere composition</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Far below us lies a hotspot. Magma that came to the ground from this hotspot has formed the islands that makeup
  Hawaii. Due to movements in the continental plates, the islands move a few centimeters northwest every year, and far
  into the future, new islands will be formed east of today&#39;s islands. Measured from the foot of the volcano, far
  below the Pacific Ocean, to the top of the island&#39;s highest point, it is more than 10,000 meters. Mount Everest
  travels 4650 meters above its foot in Nepal.</p>

  <p>The first goal that we visit to acclimatize us is Mauna Loa, a volcanic eruption who has been active for the last
  700,000 years, rising 11 centimeters a year due to the warm magma expanded in the volcano&#39;s interior. An outbreak is
  expected in the near future.</p>

  <p>The volcano titles with &ldquo;The World&#39;s Greatest Mountain&rdquo;, measured in terms of cubic meters with its
  80,000km3. Measurements are made constantly by geologists in Hawaii and it is safe to go to the top, one-mile walk and
  about 1000 altitude meters.</p>

  <p>It is an easy walk on a rocky surface that is almost alive. Constantly new streams of low-flowing lava have flowed
  down for the volcanic eruptions. That&#39;s why the volcano is really flat and even though there is snow on top, we left
  the skis in the car. The solid lava has a glassy crust on it, porous as a Swiss cheese. With the warm days and cold
  nights at 4000 meters altitude, this crust feels fast.</p>

  <p>Each step sounds both and feels like cracking bread. A long walk takes us to the top of the volcano. To the north, we
  can see Mauna Kea&#39;s white top, where we will, and then the collection is complete. It&#39;s a wonderful feeling, the
  dream will come true.</p>

  <p>Mauna Kea is in many ways a special place. 4207 meters above sea level, it is so cold that the ice from the last ice
  age is still as permafrost deep inside the inactive volcano. A few hundred meters below the top is Lake Waiau, the ice
  below the lake prevents the water from being drained through the porous volcano.</p>

  <p>For Hawaiian indigenous people, the volcano is sacred, they believed that a child&#39;s life was extended if the
  umbilical cord was sacrificed to Lake Waiau. On top of Mauna Kea, you are over 40% of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and 90%
  of the humidity of the atmosphere. This creates perfect conditions for space observations. Subaru, Keck, and AMiBA are
  just a few of the names of the high tech observatories here.</p>

  <p>The volcano consists of a series of holes of ash or small stand-alone craters. Geologists have found nearly 100 of
  these coils. On the shadow sides we find cold winter snow, but on the sides, the sun is on it is summer snow or no snow
  at all. The walk up to the top of the car is not long, I have taken the liberty of replacing the random trousers with
  real Alpine pants.</p>

  <p>Fredrik goes before me to the top, he wants to take some pictures of me when I go to the top - the last one in a
  collection of three. It feels good to come after. To go at his own pace. I look forward to all the cinderella cones, the
  landscape looks like a single big playground. I&#39;m thinking back on the other two highest mountains. The mistake of
  Tomas I finally found peace with. The hard work that made me here. The feelings are strong.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/adventure-expeditions/skiing-down-worlds-three-highest-mountains</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/adventure-expeditions/skiing-down-worlds-three-highest-mountains</guid><category><![CDATA[Adventure & Expeditions]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 10:10:31 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Fredrik Schenholm, Tormod Granheim</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Project Mercedes X-Class. Chapter 2: Wrapping and Modification]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>If you want your car to stand out from the crowd, there's a lot you can do.

Dare to try them!</p>

  <p>Makes 8</p>

  <p>330 ml of warm water<br />
  1 tsp of active dry yeast<br />
  400 g of flour, plus more for kneading and rolling out&nbsp;<br />
  2 tsp of sea salt<br />
  2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl</p>

  <p><strong>Seasonings for flatbreads:</strong><br />
  extra virgin olive oil<br />
  sesame seeds<br />
  chili flakes<br />
  sea salt flakes</p>

  <p><strong>Toppings for 4 flatbreads:&nbsp;</strong><br />
  2 aubergines, sliced into 4-5 mm slices<br />
  3 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil<br />
  4 eggs (room temperature)<br />
  &frac14; red onion, very thinly sliced<br />
  3 tbsp of harissa&nbsp;paste&nbsp;(depending on strength of the paste)<br />
  &frac12; cup of mayo<br />
  fresh coriander to garnish</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>Start with the flatbreads:</p>

  <p>Sift the flour and salt together in a large bowl and make a well in the center.</p>

  <p>Add the yeast and olive oil to the water, then pour it into the well in the dry ingredients, and stir to bring it
  together.&nbsp;The dough will be sticky and wet.</p>

  <p>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes or until smooth and quite elastic, incorporating
  extra flour as required.</p>

  <p>Oil a large bowl (about half a tablespoon of olive oil should do) and place the dough in it, turning to
  coat.&nbsp;Cover with cling film and let it sit in a warm spot until it&rsquo;s doubled in size.</p>

  <p>Preheat a griddle pan over high heat.&nbsp;Divide the dough into golf ball-sized pieces (about 8) and on a floured
  surface roll each out to form a small oval shape&nbsp;of about 5 mm thickness.</p>

  <p>Cook the flatbreads for about 1 &frac12; minute on one side until charred in spots.</p>

  <p>While the flatbread is cooking brush the exposed side with some olive oil and sprinkle with the sesame seeds and
  chili flakes.</p>

  <p>Turn the flatbread over and cook it&nbsp;briefly for about another minute or so until the bread is cooked
  through.</p>

  <p>Remove them from the heat, brush with more olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt flakes. Repeat until all the
  flatbreads are cooked.&nbsp;Wrap them in foil while you prepare the toppings.</p>

  <p>Heat some olive oil in a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Fry the aubergine in batches for about 4 mins on each side until cooked, covering the pan to keep the heat in and to
  help soften the flesh (add more oil as needed).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Transfer to a piece of greaseproof paper, season and set aside while cooking the remaining aubergine</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan of water to the boil and add the eggs. Boil for 8 mins for medium hard-boiled or 9
  mins for hard-boiled.</p>

  <p>Drain and refill the pan with cold water. Add the cooked eggs and set aside.</p>

  <p>Mix the harissa and mayo and spoon some of the mayo on the base of 4 flatbreads, then divide the aubergine and sliced
  onion between the flatbreads.</p>

  <p>Peel and thickly slice the eggs and add them on top.</p>

  <p>Finish with the remaining mayo and garnish with some fresh coriander.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/baking-cooking/olive-oil-flatbreads-fried-aubergine-boiled-eggs-harissa-mayo</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/baking-cooking/olive-oil-flatbreads-fried-aubergine-boiled-eggs-harissa-mayo</guid><category><![CDATA[Baking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 13:55:47 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Hein van Tonder</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Culinary Journey through Indonesia: Java, Bali and Sulawesi]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Indonesia is well-known for its street food culture, even though much of it is still undiscovered. This personal
  journey will take the most adventurous eaters to try some of the best dishes of this region.</p>

  <p>When you say Indonesian food, you say street food. Everything happens in the streets, and I mean literally! If you
  have been to Yogyakarta you know what I mean. Women crouch in the floor on the pedestrian path, cooking their satay
  skewers over charcoal, many other vendors generally prepare some tasty delicacies from their open houses or shacks, and
  large groups of people eat all together on the side of the busy roads.</p>

  <p>The city is bustling especially at night. From island to island there are some classics dishes&nbsp;which you
  can&rsquo;t miss, as they are widely available. Among these are <em>nasi goreng</em> (fried rice), <em>ayam goreng</em>
  (fried chicken), <em>gado gado</em> salad, <em>ikan bakar</em> (grilled fish) and <em>bakso </em>(meatball&nbsp;soup).
  Grilled meats and fish are generally accompanied by a fiery sambal dip (a variety of the chili sauce). <em>Gado
  gado</em> is one of my favorite Indonesian dishes:&nbsp;a vegetarian salad with tofu, bean curd, <em>lontong
  </em>(compressed rice cake) beansprouts and vegetables, topped with a sweet and subtly spicy satay sauce.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Everything is cooked fresh in Indonesia</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You can&rsquo;t leave Indonesia until you have tried a few chicken satay! These tender chicken skewers are grilled
  and served with peanuts sauce. Chicken is especially tasty in Indonesia;&nbsp;they are generally left free to roam in
  the countryside and their meat is therefore flavorsome and juicy. <em>Ikan bakar </em>is one of the classic dishes, with
  a really straightforward recipe: just take some fresh seafood and grill it over charcoal, and then serve it with rice,
  fried green vegetables (<em>kankung goreng</em>) and a sambal sauce.</p>

  <p>In Indonesia, everything is cooked fresh. The rule of thumb to spot the best vendors is either to check their queues
  or to ask your taxi driver or any other local. Bali feels like a different world coming from Java or Sulawesi, and you
  might find some great dishes which are typical Balinese delicacies. <em>Babi guling</em> is one of these. The word
  literally means &#39;roasted suckling pig&#39;, it is accompanied by a bumbu (spice paste) and served with rice, blood
  sausage and crunchy crackling. It is spicy and fragrant, and truly addictive. Another lucky discovering in Bali,
  recommended by my tour guide, was&nbsp;<em>ayam betutu</em>. &#39;Ayam&#39; stands for chicken, which&nbsp;is served
  with a spicy mix of herbs and steamed rice that will help you to cut through the spiciness of the dish.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Spot the best vendors by checking their queues or asking&nbsp;your taxi driver</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Many enter Sulawesi through the big city of Makassar, the main gateway to other destinations on the island. The city
  itself is not particularly attractive, but the food scene is interesting. Seafood is one of the highlights and a great
  discovery was <em>konro</em>. <em>Konro </em>is a delicacy from South Sulawesi made with tender beef ribs&nbsp;which are
  first marinated in spices, then braised and grilled. The ribs are either served in a soup or with a peanut sauce.</p>

  <p>There is a lot to explore all around Indonesia and every island has something unique and different from the other
  islands. As history told us, many regions have just been merged under that&nbsp;same name&nbsp;only in fairly recent
  years. Let your senses guide you and don&rsquo;t be shy to ask around and eat as the locals do.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/culinary-journey-java-bali-sulawesi-indonesia</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/culinary-journey-java-bali-sulawesi-indonesia</guid><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 14:01:01 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Jennifer Cauli</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bentley Continental GT Convertible — The Best of the Best]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>The new Bentley Continental <span class="caps">GT</span> Convertible is stronger, more luxurious and more elegant
  than ever, but also easier on the environment!</p>

  <p>Private jets, luxury yachts and cars like the new Bentley Continental GT Convertible are not for everyone. But
  it&rsquo;s not fair to blame our environmental problems on the people who can afford to buy and use these modes of
  transportation. In many cases, these cars, boats and aircrafts are what drives technology forward. One example is the
  engine of the new Bentley Continental GT, which, despite 12 cylinders and dual turbochargers, has seen a 16% decrease in
  carbon dioxide emissions compared to its predecessor. This new technology is always found in the most expensive and
  lavish car models but trickles down to the cheaper models over time.</p>

  <p>Bentley is celebrating centenary this year, and what better way to do it than releasing a fantastic roofless creation
  like the Continental GT Convertible. The brand was founded in 1919 by Walter Owen Bentley, an engineer who originally
  studied to be a steam locomotive designer. Something their competitors were quick to point out because of the large and
  robust nature of Bentley cars. In the 1920s, Bentley asserted their dominance with no fewer than five victories in the
  classic 24-hour race at Le Mans. In 1931, Bentley was bought by Rolls-Royce and moved to Derby, later Crewe. Since 1998,
  the brand has been owned by Volkswagen AG. The name Continental has been used since 1952.</p>

  <p>The heart of the new Bentley Continental GT Convertible is a W12 engine totaling 626 horses. The W simply means that
  two V6 engines have been intertwined into a 12-cylinder W engine. The total cylinder volume is six liters and thanks to
  the dual turbochargers, the Continental GT Convertible does 0-100 in only 3.7 seconds. Considering the weight of over
  two tons, this is quite an impressive number. Despite the powerful torque of 900 nm, the 8-step dual transmission
  manages to get all of the power to the wheels and into the ground.</p>

  <p>Even though there is another car brand in the same class as Bentley who named one of their latest models after a
  gemstone, comparing the new Continental GT Convertible to a jewel on wheels is not a stretch. Just take a look at the
  headlights that look like they are made of actual crystals. You can see an incredibly beautiful and glittering effect
  through them, even in daylight, and the blue paint job has a wonderful glow in the morning light.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>In the 1920s, Bentley asserted their dominance with five victories in the classic 24-hour race at Le
  Mans</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The doors are stepless, which is something Aston Martin were the first to introduce. This means you get to decide the
  angle of the door, instead of relying on the default modes of a regular car. When you get in the new Continental GT
  Convertible and close the door, it&#39;s like the outside world stops and your senses open up to a new dimension.
  Everything is perfect; the immense feeling of quality is far beyond average.</p>

  <p>Every detail so well made, like all the knobs made of milled metal. Just touching and feeling them instills respect
  for the craftsmanship that has gone into the Continental GT Convertible. If you are not used to this type of
  craftsmanship, which people generally are not, you&rsquo;ll find yourself zoning out, just sitting there soaking it all
  in. But if you do manage to break the spell and do what you are supposed to, which is actually starting the car and
  driving, the next dimension will open up and the real experience can begin.</p>

  <p>The key is big, just like the car, but it obviously stays in your pocket or handbag as you start the car with a push
  of a button. The twelve cylinders are brought to life in a modest way, as to avoid waking up the entire neighborhood.
  After all, we are talking about a dignified luxury car, despite the amount of horsepower and top performance. However,
  that doesn&#39;t mean it will embarrass itself when put to the test. Richard Hammond righty used the metaphor that the
  new Bentley Continental GT is &ldquo;a beautiful lady who lifts her skirt to be able to run&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s what driving the Continental GT Convertible feels like; it moves forward in such a pleasant and graceful
  way that you can&rsquo;t in your wildest imagination think that it should be able to do anything else. But as soon as
  you push down the gas pedal a little harder, the power is brought to life and the graceful stride is suddenly replaced
  with the one of a sprinter. The Continental GT Convertible easily launches you past 300 km/h, and the top speed
  isn&rsquo;t achieved until the speedometer reaches 333 km/h.</p>

  <p>The new Continental GT Convertible comes with two different spec kits; one for those who mainly drive in cities, and
  the other for those who spend more time on open, long roads. The City Specification includes features like automatic
  trunk opening, sign identification, an overview camera and automatic brakes that detect and stop for pedestrians. The
  Touring Specification includes Adaptive Cruise Control with Traffic Jam Assist, Lane Keeping Assist, heads-up display,
  auto brakes and night vision using an infrared camera.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>A fun quirky detail is the rotating panel of the dashboard. This allows you to choose between either a 12.3-inch
  screen for navigation and infotainment or three analog dials with a clock, the outside temperature and a compass - or
  hide everything and keep it minimalistic.</p>

  <p>If you want to experience the best of the best is definitely a Bentley Continental GT Convertible way to go. Of
  course, there are other brands and models in this class even if it doesn&#39;t cry about them. with British feeling and
  charisma.</p>

  well-known destination it offers so much more to see and taste when veering off the usual routes. </p>

  <p>Southeast Asia is one of the most popular holiday destinations with its vibrant culture, iconic street food,
  world-renowned beaches and value for money attracting visitors from all over the world. But these destinations offer so
  much more outside of the popular.</p>

  <p>The Southern Tourism Corridor is a cooperation among Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam established in 2007, with Myanmar
  invited to join in 2018. Some of the provinces included are&nbsp;Rayong and Chanthaburi in Thailand, Kampot in
  Cambodia&nbsp;and Phu Quoc Island in Vietnam, and I was invited by the Tourism Authority of Thailand to explore the
  Corridor from a gastronomic&nbsp;perspective.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>When in Rayong, do not miss&nbsp;Khrua Ban Ban, the restaurant of&nbsp;Masterchef Thailand&#39;s finalist Jumlong
  Sriraksa. He&nbsp;will make&nbsp;sure you order his signature dish, Volcano Eggs</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Tha Chalaep is a small town in the Chantaburi province of Thailand. Boarding a boat in town you will get to one of
  the local oyster farms owned by Pa Louise Lung Thom, known as Uncle Thom. The trip offers a fascinating glimpse into his
  life as an oyster farmer, with the visit culminating in a feast of fresh oysters, cooked crab, fried whole fish, fish
  cakes, tom yum soup and many more local dishes.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Not far from Tha Chalaep is Chanthaburi, the capital of the province. Start your visit at the cathedral of the
  Immaculate Conception, one of the biggest churches in Thailand. There is a short walk from there to the
  three-centuries-old&nbsp;Old Town Chanthaboon Waterfront, steeped in history as an important trade center and
  international port. Enjoy a slow walk in the narrow kilometer-long lane offering picturesque views of historic homes.
  The community is well-known for its street food -&nbsp;enjoy their freshly baked madeleines, sweets, iced coffees and
  durian ice cream as you wander its historical streets.</p>

  <p>Market visits are mandatory when in Thailand, and the Charoensuk Market is a must-do. It offers a vast selection of
  fresh products, seafood and ingredients, and you can join locals as they do their daily shopping for cooking at home.
  Some stalls also offer freshly-cooked traditional meals that can be purchased and enjoyed at home for those who are too
  busy to cook.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>From Chanthaburi we traveled to the Rayong province, which offers a more peaceful beach experience than other popular
  beach destinations in Thailand. The Rayong province is well-known for its seasonal tropical fruit of rambutan,
  mangosteen and the world-famous durian, as well as salak that is grown all year round. The people of the province
  produce a variety of seafood products, and the very important&nbsp;fish sauce, as well as shrimp paste and many
  dried-fish products. A visit to the Ban Phe Market located near the fishing boat port offers a vast array of dried
  seafood products produced in the area. This&nbsp;market is an obligated&nbsp;stop before taking a boat to Ko Samet or
  Samet Island.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Not to be missed in Rayong is Jumlong Sriraksa&#39;s restaurant, Khrua Ban Ban. The Masterchef Thailand&#39;s
  finalist dishes up some of the best food we had on the trip and makes sure you order his signature dish, Volcano Eggs.
  He did not want to share the recipe but it was&nbsp;the fluffiest souffle seafood omelet I ever tasted, almost engulfed
  in flames as it was&nbsp;brought to the table - what a delight to see and enjoy!</p>

What would I be eating
  on a mission to photograph the glaciers in Iran?</p>

  <p>Restrictions on weight and space, and the need to keep ingredients fresh really limit what is possible to conjure up
  on a single burner in a freezing camp, amid snowy peaks and barren landscapes.&nbsp;I was documenting the vital glaciers
  of this beautiful yet forbidding land as part of Project Pressure, a charity I&#39;ve set up to highlight the impact of
  climate change on the world&#39;s vanishing glaciers. Project Pressure uses art combined with scientific research and
  data to inspire action and participation.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Glaciers and Iran may seem like an&nbsp;oxymoron</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Today you can find glaciers in three regions in Iran. They are all relatively close, less than a day&#39;s journey
  between the various mountains, but the contrasts are stark. I was hot by the Caspian Sea, 28 meters below sea level, but
  there are glaciers on the nearby mountains towering almost 5000 meters.</p>

  <p>On our glacier mission we encountered a very varied landscape, it was as inspiring as the food was disappointing. We
  had a local mountain guide who was also supposed to cook, a common practice on these treks. But this man&#39;s
  gastronomic ambitions never ventured beyond what could be sourced from a tin.</p>

  <p>He hated cooking and could not care less about the food. I found the whole thing rather depressing, so I offered to
  cook. The landscapes, full of tasty-looking crops and intriguing food stalls, should be enough to whet anyone&#39;s
  appetite. A lot of Iran&#39;s produce is sourced from its &#39;green belt&#39;, an area from the 4,000-meter high ranges
  of the Alborz mountains slopes all the way down to the Caspian Sea.</p>

  <p>Between the two are panoramic landscapes of rainforests and lush landscapes. I saw fields with tropical fruits, rice
  and loads of tasty looking vegetables in the valleys; the climate allows to harvest three times a year. We stopped to
  buy melons in a roadside shop where the tarpaulin outside was overflowing with ripe water&nbsp;and honey melons, which
  we cut up and had for breakfast the next morning.</p>

  <p>Most times, food shopping was straight from the source. On our way to reaching Mount Sabalan we stopped in a small
  town and picked up fresh chickens and herbs. At the foothills of Sabalan, a small river was flowing. This was the hub of
  the village and was used for everything, from people washing themselves (mostly upstream) to cleaning knives and tools
  when butchering sheep (mostly happened downstream).</p>

  <p>The sheep were killed and butchered in the clean running water and then pumped full of air so the skin would balloon
  up and could be removed easily. Then each organ was rinsed individually in the river. After about fifteen minutes the
  whole animal had been cut up, intestines cleaned out and everything ready to eat.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The butchers were cutting out intestines while they chatted and smoked cigarettes</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We were short on time and opted for a taste of the local kebab; these nearly&nbsp;always consist of variations of the
  goat. The goat meat is cooked on skewers over charcoal and served with salad and a piece of bread. It does get a bit
  repetitive but tastes great.</p>

  <p>Next we headed up the mountain and a few hours later we were setting up base camp at the American Mosque, where we
  stayed a few nights. The American Mosque was built by American soldiers during the Second World War, and&nbsp;is now
  used as base camp for locals wanting to summit Mount Sabalan at 4,811. In winter, the mountain doubles as a ski
  resort.</p>

  <p>We got to the mosque on a weekend when local climbing crews gathered; we shared food, pans and ingredients. That
  evening I cooked a chicken and rice dish, seasoned with local saffron (very cheap in Iran), chopped tarragon, chilies,
  and mushrooms fried in olive oil.</p>

  <p>On the way back to Tehran we stopped for snacks in a kiosk, where the ice-cream poster would have raised child
  protection alarms in other places but didn&#39;t raise an eyebrow here. As we left the mountains behind, I bought an ice
  cream as my &ldquo;expedition cooking&rdquo;&nbsp;had come to an end. I was now ready to go and explore Tehran.</p>

  such a delicious treat at any time of the day - especially with a good cup of coffee… </p>

  <p><strong>For the babka dough:</strong></p>

  <p>300 g of plain flour</p>

  <p>7 g of dried yeast (1 sachet)</p>

  <p>1 teaspoon of salt</p>

  <p>20 g of caster sugar</p>

  <p>125 ml of&nbsp;whole milk</p>

  <p>2 medium eggs, lightly whisked</p>

  <p>75 g of unsalted butter, diced and softened</p>

  <p><strong>For the chocolate filling:</strong></p>

  <p>120 g of dark chocolate</p>

  <p>75 g of unsalted butter</p>

  <p>20 g of cocoa powder</p>

  <p>30 g of light brown sugar</p>

  <p>75 g of pistachios, roughly chopped</p>

  <p>100 g of tahini</p>

  <p>flaked sea salt</p>

  <p><strong>For the syrup:</strong></p>

  <p>100 g of caster sugar</p>

  <p>75 ml of water</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>Place the flour, salt, sugar and yeast in the bowl of an electric mixer and mix briefly to combine.</p>

  <p>Add the milk and eggs and mix on a low/medium speed to combine. The dough should start coming together and away from
  the sides of the bowl. After about 5 minutes of mixing, add the diced butter with the mixer still running.</p>

  <p>Turn up the speed to medium/high and mix for 10 minutes until smooth, elastic and shiny.</p>

  <p>Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Refrigerate overnight until doubled in
  size.</p>

  <p>The next morning, prepare the filling by placing all the ingredients apart from the pistachios and tahini into a
  small saucepan. Melt slowly over low heat until completely smooth, gently stirring to stop the chocolate from catching.
  Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool and thicken to a paste.</p>

  <p>Grease a 9 &times; 5 inches loaf tin with butter and line the base with a strip of baking parchment with overhangs on
  the side so you can easily lift out the babka.</p>

  <p>Take the dough out of the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured surface to a large rectangle, roughly 30 &times;
  40 cm. Spread over the chocolate mixture, leaving a small border around the outside. Sprinkle over the pistachios and
  drizzle over the tahini.</p>

  <p>Tightly roll up the dough starting from the long edge until you have a long sausage shape. Using a sharp knife, slice
  the roll down the middle lengthways so you have two long pieces. With the cut side facing upwards, place one piece of
  dough on top of the other forming an X shape. Starting from the middle of the X, braid the two pieces of dough, placing
  one on top of the other. Repeat on the other side so you have a braid of dough.</p>

  <p>Carefully lift the dough into the loaf tin, loosely cover with cling film and leave to rise for 1.5 hours or until
  the dough has doubled in size.</p>

  <p>Preheat the oven to 190&ordm;C / 170&ordm;C fan. Place the loaf tin on the middle shelf and bake for 25-30 minutes.
  The loaf should be well risen and golden brown.</p>

  <p>While the loaf is baking, place the sugar and water in a small saucepan and heat to dissolve the sugar.</p>

  <p>Once the babka has baked, generously brush all over with the syrup. Allow cooling completely before slicing and
  serving.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/food-wine/tahini-pistachio-and-dark-chocolate-babka</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/food-wine/tahini-pistachio-and-dark-chocolate-babka</guid><category><![CDATA[Food & Wine]]></category><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 09:32:02 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Holly Farrier, Talia Yilmaz</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tomato and Ginger Soup]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>A quick treat for those unexpected visits on the cold winter evenings…</p>

  chicken soup that immediately made we want to stay longer than what our schedule allowed.</p>

  <p>I was invited by the Tourism Authority of Thailand to explore the Southern Tourism Corridor from a gastronomy
  perspective, visiting &mdash;and tasting&mdash;&nbsp;Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. The Southern Tourism Corridor is a
  tourism cooperation established in 2007. Southeast Asia is one of the most popular holiday destinations for South
  Africans, with its vibrant culture, iconic street food, world-renowned beaches and value for money attracting visitors
  from all over the world. But these destinations offer so much more outside of the popular, well-known locations where
  authentic food experiences can be discovered.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Kampot&nbsp;is known all over the world for its pepper. Do not leave without&nbsp;trying their&nbsp;pepper ice
  cream: what a flavor explosion!</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Kampot, in Cambodia, used to be an important port city during the 19th century under French rule. It is a small city
  filled with French colonial architecture, but where you will even find&nbsp;a roundabout in honor of the durian fruit.
  This town has some sort of sleepy charm, mostly enjoyed by local tourists - visiting it&nbsp;is just so worth
  it.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Kampot&nbsp;is also known all over the world for its pepper. Pay a visit to La Plantation, one of Kampot&#39;s most
  famous pepper farms, at &#39;only&#39; 140 kilometers from&nbsp;Phnom Penh. In this&nbsp;must-do,&nbsp;pepper tastings
  are&nbsp;provided, followed by a tour of the plantations that grow the pepper and produce&nbsp;the
  different&nbsp;variants of green, black, red and white, and even&nbsp;those&nbsp;fiery long peppers from Indonesia.</p>

  <p>In addition to the shop and its&nbsp;array of pepper products for sale, there are two restaurants on the farm, one
  serving traditional Khmer (Cambodian, in the local language) dishes and the other serving food with a French flavor, but
  both using the locally-grown pepper in their dishes. Do make a point of trying one of the pepper ice creams, a flavor
  explosion!</p>

  <p>Sunset in Kampot is best experienced on a river cruise. There are many boats available that will take you on a slow
  cruise on the Praek Tuek Chhu River. Enjoy the beautiful and lush scenery as the sun sets, and if you are lucky, a visit
  from local fireflies.</p>

  <p>The Kampot Market is anything but sleepy. The vibrant sights and sounds&nbsp;are intoxicating and it is easy to spend
  hours there. Pass the clothing shops as you enter and walk towards the jewelry stalls in the back, where many artisans
  craft their own pieces.&nbsp;To the left of the jewelry section is the fresh food section, filled with traders selling
  the best products on&nbsp;seafood and meat. Food does not get any fresher, and for a Westerner the scenes might
  sometimes be uneasy, but this is real farm brought directly to your table. Here, going to the market every day to do
  your groceries is a way of life and not a trend.</p>

  <p>Kampot might be famous for its pepper, but it is just as famous for its salt. Most salt fields are located outside of
  town, where the seawater is brought from the sea, which is about five&nbsp;kilometers away. The water is left to
  evaporate until the salt crystals form, and&nbsp;seeing that&nbsp;crystal shine at sunrise is well worth getting up
  early for.</p>

  <p>One of the last nights of our trip, we were hosted for dinner by the Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia.&nbsp; Khmer
  chicken soup was one of the dishes of the evening, and it&nbsp;immediately made we want to stay much longer than what
  our schedule allowed. It had so much flavor, and it was as rich and comforting as a bowl of good chicken soup can be. I
  asked if the chef would be willing to share his recipe, and at the end of the dinner, he came out to share it with me
  &mdash; you will find it in my next story, here at Enliven.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Having the chance to experience&nbsp;something for the first time is one of the most wonderful things in life, and
  even though Cambodia is a&nbsp;well-known destination, it&nbsp;offers so much more to see &mdash;and taste&mdash; when
  veering off the usual routes.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/feasting-beaten-track-cambodia-southeast-asia</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/feasting-beaten-track-cambodia-southeast-asia</guid><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:40:01 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Hein van Tonder</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercedes Maybach GLS – A Star on the SUV Sky]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>If you think the already luxurious Mercedes <span class="caps">GLS</span> is not lavish enough, take a look at the
  new Maybach version of the brand's largest <span class="caps">SUV</span>.</p>

  <p>In a &ldquo;secret&rdquo;&nbsp;photo studio near the Mercedes Headquarters, I was the only Scandinavian who was given
  the exclusive opportunity to photograph the, at the time secret and brand-new, Maybach model. The car is based on the
  model GLS, which is Mercedes&#39;s largest SUV, and will be (at the time of writing) presented&nbsp;at the LA Motor
  Show.</p>

  <p>The first thing that strikes you when you get to see this creation is the grillwork, shining like a big, hefty and
  chromed waterfall grill. Instead of the star being placed in the grill like the other SUV models from Mercedes, it has
  been placed on top of the hood. This is a reoccurring feature of the Maybach model, but it&rsquo;s the first time
  it&rsquo;s been implemented on an SUV.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>You should be able to tell if it&rsquo;s a GLS coming towards you, even when it&rsquo;s dark</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The story of the Maybach goes way back. Wilhelm Maybach started manufacturing airship engines in 1909, expanding to
  car engines in 1919. His company suffered from the war and was subsequently bought by Daimler-Benz in 1960, meant to be
  a part of the diesel engine manufacturer MTU. 42 years later, the brand was reintroduced to the market offering
  extremely luxurious limousines. They were based on the Mercedes S-class but were significantly modified leading to a
  remarkably high price. Unfortunately, the brand was never financially stable and eventually disappeared. The final
  rebirth of the name Maybach came with the release of new versions of already existing Mercedes models.</p>

  <p>The Maybach GLS is the first SUV with the Maybach emblem. A G-class Maybach by the name of G 650 Landaulet has been
  produced though, which is a further development of G500 4x4. It has a longer wheelbase and a so-called landaulet roof,
  meaning only the backseat is covered by a convertible top, while the front seat has a regular roof.</p>

  <p>When designing the Maybach GLS, Mercedes wanted to make a unique car that stood out from other luxury SUVs. The main
  competitors are Bentley Bentayga and Rolls Royce Cullinan. The price for these two is higher than the Maybach GLS though
  - Cullinan being the most expensive. A slightly more affordable alternative to the Maybach GLS would be the
  Autobiography version of the Range Rover Vogue.</p>

  <p>Among the exclusive things you get when you order a Maybach GLS, eight choices of two-tone paint schemes is one of
  them. This means that the hood and roof are painted in one color and the lower part of the bodywork in another.
  Separating the colors is a thin white line, a detail mainly found on historic luxury cars. The lower parts of the car
  are glossy black paint instead of the matte black plastic found on the regular GLS. Apart from the grill, the headlights
  have undergone some changes in an attempt to separate the Maybach GLS from the normal one. You should be able to tell if
  it&rsquo;s a GLS coming towards you, even when it&rsquo;s dark. The amount of chromium used on the Maybach GLS
  definitely exceeds what you normally see in a car. The front, the rims and lots of other details are made in shiny
  chrome.</p>

  <p>Another detail that is found in several places of the car is a design element in the grill. The vertical ribs in the
  grill are narrow at the bottom, but just before they meet the upper part of the grill, they bulge slightly. This shape
  can also be found on the exclusive 23-inch rims as well as the electronically controlled side steps, which are also
  provided with the Maybach emblem. The Maybach emblem is also found in a number of places in the car. It is obvious that
  this. On the back of the D-pillar is a shiny Maybach emblem, just like on the other models, but made in a larger size
  for the Maybach GLS.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The Maybach GLS is primarily intended for the American, Asian and Middle Eastern markets. It&rsquo;s hard to say
  how many will be sold in Europe and Scandinavia</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Unlike the usual GLS, the Maybach is only available with two-row seating and not three. You could pick a backseat
  that fits three people, but I prefer the one with two retractable seats, essentially allowing you to lay perfectly flat.
  Another advantage of having only two seats is that you can fit a surprisingly spacious wine cooler between the chairs,
  capable of accommodating up to three bottles of champagne (or water if that&rsquo;s your preference).</p>

  <p>The beautiful wooden panel covering the refrigerator is called The Waterfall and naturally has a Maybach emblem. Wood
  paneling usually doesn&rsquo;t go in modern cars, but when it comes to this car you can&rsquo;t really complain, because
  they really exude luxury. Other than the panels and the chrome details, it is almost impossible to find a single surface
  that is not leather.&nbsp;But not only the backseat is blessed with the Maybach luxury. The driver&#39;s seat also has a
  lot of exclusive details you can only find in a Maybach GLS, like new and unique Maybach pedals or a steering wheel and
  a gear knob with the Maybach emblem.</p>

  <p>But above all a performance mode selector unique to Maybach GLS, which also has its own interface in the digital
  dashboard in front of the steering wheel. The fully digital infotainment system can be controlled either via the
  11.6-inch touch screens in the back or via a tablet that is separable from the car. This is where you control seat
  heating etc. Many of the features of Maybach GLS are taken directly from the S-class Maybach.</p>

  <p>In addition to the amazing panoramic glass ceiling, backlit panels are everywhere to provide sufficient light, in the
  color of your choice of course. Complimenting the magnificent sound system from Burmester, the leather on the interior
  panels has a dampening effect on any unwanted sound. The car is also equipped with acoustic glass that removes outside
  noise. These features combined provide a world-class listening experience.</p>

  <p>The unique performance mode of the Maybach GLS is developed for optimal comfort in the backseat. A variety of
  parameters for the powertrain and air suspension have been set to achieve the desired result, but I&rsquo;ll have to
  come back to that when it is time for a test run. There is only one option when it comes to the engine, which is a
  four-liter V8 that generates 558 horsepower. Thanks to hybrid technology, this car does 0-100 in under five seconds. The
  power can be distributed dynamically between the front and rear through the so-called &ldquo;Torque on
  Demand&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>The Maybach GLS is primarily intended for the American, Asian and Middle Eastern markets. It&rsquo;s hard to say how
  many will be sold in Europe and Scandinavia, given the prevailing attitude towards luxury cars in this format. But if
  you can and want to travel by car in a way that you would expect from a private jet, the Maybach GLS is the way to
  go.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/automotive/english-mercedes-maybach-gls-star-suv</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/automotive/english-mercedes-maybach-gls-star-suv</guid><category><![CDATA[Automotive]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:37:43 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>James Holm</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Best Wild Mushroom Risotto]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Oh my. That's all we could say when this risotto came to the table.</p>

  <p>For 4 people</p>

  <p>30 g of porcini mushrooms</p>

  <p>2 banana shallots, finely diced</p>

  <p>2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p>100 g of butter</p>

  <p>250 g of risotto rice (arborio or canaroli are both good)</p>

  <p>120 ml of white wine</p>

  <p>1-1.5l of vegetable stock</p>

  <p>100 g of parmesan, finely grated</p>

  <p>150 g of wild mushrooms, cleaned with a damp brush (shitake, girolle, chestnut, oyster)</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>Begin by soaking the porcini mushrooms in 200 ml boiling water for at least 10 minutes.</p>

  <p>Drain the porcini over a small saucepan, retaining the porcini stock in the pan and placing&nbsp;it over the heat to
  bring to a gentle simmer. Prepare the vegetable stock by heating it to a simmer in a separate saucepan.</p>

  <p>Finely chop through the soaked mushrooms and set aside.</p>

  <p>While the porcini are soaking, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil and 25 g of the butter in a deep, heavy-based frying pan. Add
  the shallots and sweat down over a low to medium heat until softened and just starting to take on color. Add the garlic
  and fry for a&nbsp;minute.</p>

  <p>Add the risotto rice to the pan and fry for 5 minutes over a medium to high heat, stirring to coat the rice grains.
  The grains should start to appear transparent and become too hot to hold.</p>

  <p>Add the white wine and bring to a boil to evaporate off the alcohol.</p>

  <p>Once the wine has been absorbed, start adding the porcini stock, one ladle at a time. Once the rice has soaked up all
  the liquid, add another ladle and continue until all the porcini stock is finished. Then continue this process with the
  vegetable stock.</p>

  <p>After about 10 minutes, add the chopped porcini mushrooms. After another 8-12 minutes the rice should be cooked
  through to al dente &ndash; it should have some bite to it but not taste chalky.</p>

  <p>Adjust the cooking and consistency to your liking, adding more stock if you prefer a looser, creamier consistency.
  Risotto should have a &lsquo;sigh&rsquo; to it instead of sitting on the plate in a lump.</p>

  <p>Take off the heat and stir in 50 g of the butter and parmesan, reserving some of the cheese to garnish. Taste and
  adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper (the parmesan will give a lot of salty flavour). Cover the pan with a
  lid and leave to sit for 5 minutes.</p>

  <p>While the risotto is resting, heat a separate frying pan with a little oil and butter and fry the fresh mushrooms
  over medium heat, until softened slightly and starting to take on a golden color. Sprinkle over a little sea salt and
  set aside.</p>

  <p>Stir through the risotto and divide between the four&nbsp;plates. Sprinkle over the extra parmesan and finish with
  the wild mushrooms.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/best-wild-mushroom-risotto</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/best-wild-mushroom-risotto</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 14:30:30 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Holly Farrier, Talia Yilmaz</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grilled Fig and Labneh Tartines]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>A super quick and delicious way to use the fruit in more of a savory dish.</p>

  <p>Alfonso and Nila opened Molinera&rsquo;s doors in 1985 and&nbsp;in a short time it became one of the essential
  restaurants for trying the Galician <em>cocido galego</em>, their main course, together with their&nbsp;excellent
  selection of fish and meat, another cardinal element of its gastronomic offer.</p>

  <p>Top-quality products, dishes prepared with care, interesting winery, loyal clients, and family efforts have been the
  keys to the success of this traditional restaurant, which found its place on the Galician gastronomy map.</p>

  <p>While the family business was growing, Diego, the founder&rsquo;s son, discovered his vocation for cooking while
  studying at the Hotel Management School of Santiago de Compostela. Diego focused his career towards avant-garde cuisine
  by working in important restaurants such as Dos Cielos in Barcelona, ​​La Terraza del Casino in Madrid and Casa Solla in
  Poio, Pontevedra.</p>

  <p>In 2010 Diego, being just 22 years old, joined the family business. There&nbsp;he found a clientele who remained
  faithful to the snack of the day and to the traditional menu offered by his parents. But he had trained in the
  avant-garde cuisine and he wanted to apply it. Was it necessary to choose between traditional cuisine and contemporary?
  For Diego, both were&nbsp;complementary and could coexist. So there were no radical changes in La Molinera
  -&nbsp;traditional cuisine and modern gastronomy live naturally.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>We have a pig farm&nbsp;that works exclusively for us, and we&nbsp;also buy pigs from private farms. That&rsquo;s
  why we are unique</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The restaurant still keeps its usual menu, with <em>cocido</em>&nbsp;as the&nbsp;main dish of the season, and an
  accurate selection of fish and beef from the area, like their fabulous <em>chulet&oacute;n de&nbsp;vaca
  vella</em>:&nbsp;beef that follows&nbsp;a controlled maturation process that can continue from thirty to sixty days, or
  even more. When it&#39;s&nbsp;hunting season,&nbsp;<em>becadas</em>&nbsp;(woodcock) can also be found on the menu.
  A&nbsp;gastronomic offer that reflects Diego&#39;s culinary personality.</p>

  <p>The furniture and decoration of La Molinera have&nbsp;not changed that much since they opened, back&nbsp;in the 80s.
  The entrance,&nbsp;towards a large room, has&nbsp;several tables and a service bar. The dining room is a great
  space&nbsp;that summarizes the meaning of a classic traditional Galician restaurant: a charming and&nbsp;welcoming
  service, tables occupied by regular customers, business lunches and the occasional tourists tasting their famous
  stew.</p>

  <p>La Molinera&acute;s&nbsp;<em>cocido</em>&nbsp;is served in four passages: first the soup, followed by a pot
  with&nbsp;potatoes, chickpeas, turnip greens, onion,&nbsp;chorizo and pork meat. After that, the
  <em>cacheira</em>&nbsp;(salted pork head) is chopped in front of the guests and served together with another meat cut
  called &ldquo;lac&oacute;n&rdquo;. Last but not least, the rest of the&nbsp;meat selection will arrive at the table,
  completing the whole pork:&nbsp;backbone, tail, bacon, snout, ear, tongue, feet, brisket and&nbsp;pancetta salted rib -
  and a bit of chicken.</p>

  <p>It might sound like a very complete meal, but it would not be perfect without a proper closing: a dessert
  of&nbsp;Galician cheese with <em>membrillo</em> (quince paste), <em>filloas</em> with honey, iced
  <em>rosquillas</em>&nbsp;and <em>ca&ntilde;itas de crema</em> (pastries filled with cream).</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/la-molinera-lalin-galician-cuisine-spain</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/la-molinera-lalin-galician-cuisine-spain</guid><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2019 14:01:01 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Liana Solís</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crispy Onion Tart]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>A perfect dish for autumn. The rustic, yet delicious onion art will bring some beautiful vibes to your table.

It is a watch that is easily recognizable and conveys a feeling
  of elegant confidence.</p>

  <p>Rolex is a watch company everyone knows. They have a wide range of watches and sometimes you can even feel a little
  bit lost among all the different kinds of models. One of their models that they updated for the Baselworld 2019 is an
  exclusive classic. It is stylish, elegant and incredibly beautiful.</p>

  <p>2019 is the year for a whole new generation of Oyster Perpetual Day-Date 36, which for the first time has received
  the in-house clockwork Calibre 3255. It is a new generation of clockworks that was introduced last year and which is now
  also available in this model. The power reserve has been expanded and now lasts 70 hours.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The watch in gold, the dial in green and eight diamonds for SEK 323 850</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Oyster Perpetual Day-Date created a new era when it was presented for the first time in 1956. It was a great
  innovation in the watch industry in being the first wristwatch that, besides being able to show dates, could also show
  the day of the week in text. Centrally located in place of the number 12 index, the day of the week is displayed with
  text in a small window. The text is available in 26 different languages.</p>

  <p>At first launch, a new bracelet called the President Bracelet was also presented, becoming the hallmark of the model
  while giving it the nickname President&rsquo;s Watch. The model was an immediate success and has, and is, worn on many
  famous wrists.</p>

  <p>The watch is waterproof up to 100 m and as always, the Day-Date collection is made in noble metals such as yellow
  gold, white gold, ros&eacute; gold or platinum. In this year&#39;s new models, no one is in platinum. You can read about
  five different styles of the new and beautiful Oyster Perpetual Day-Date 36 below.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Rich green</em></strong></p>

  <p>This one feels the most like Rolex, simply because it has the green dial that has become synonymous with the brand.
  It is decorated with eight diamonds as indexes, two baguette-cut diamonds indicating 6 and 9 and has a golden strap.
  Approx. price SEK 323 850.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Warm color</em></strong></p>

  <p>Watch in Everose (Ros&eacute; gold) with a brown dial. The color combination makes for a warm look while also looking
  incredibly trendy. This one also has eight diamonds as indexes and two baguette-cut diamonds indicating 6 and 9. Approx.
  price SEK 349 850.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Women&#39;s dream</em></strong></p>

  <p>This is the model that will capture the attention of many women. It is in white gold with a pink opal dial. The
  indexes are also white gold with a total of 32 diamonds. On the Roman numerals VI and IX, there are a total of 24
  diamonds. The case has a total of 52 brilliant-cut diamonds. Price upon request.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Colorful</em></strong></p>

Chapter 1: Four Amaroks and One X]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>How an idea and a dream were transformed into action and reality.</p>

  <p>To be perfectly honest and answer why I drive a pickup, it&rsquo;s not because driving heavy rocks around is part of
  my job description... However, I do often use the bed of the truck when working as a photographer. The ability to sit on
  it to take pictures and to quickly access an elevated surface is invaluable for me. But so is the reliability of always
  knowing that I can get to and from work regardless of weather or road conditions. If you are to combine these
  requirements in a car, the only option is a pickup.</p>

  <p>Hence my choice. Of course, the fact that it counts as a work vehicle, making it easier to manage financially for my
  business, was also a factor. Rebuilding it simply had to do with the fact that you blend into the crowd if you
  don&rsquo;t attract attention. It started with the Volkswagen Amarok, which I have since owned four of. I&rsquo;d had my
  eyes on this car for a long time but had not really understood the benefits, other than the rugged exterior.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em></em><em>I was offered a discounted Amarok through Volkswagen Sverige</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It was comfortable and spacious and performed really well even in bad road conditions and terrain. What was missing
  and later fixed with my other Amarok was to understand how to get to that &ldquo;beefy&rdquo; look.</p>

  <p>At first I thought I just had to get a bullbar with extra lights and wider tires, but it wasn&rsquo;t that simple.
  The bullbar and lights were provided the company Trucker, but to solve the problem of larger tires, some changes had to
  be made. The car needed to be raised as well as some larger fender skirts so that the tires wouldn&rsquo;t stick out.
  Something I did not fully understand initially and also never got on my first Amarok.</p>

  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I was first introduced to the Delta 4x4 company and got in touch with OCL Brorssons, the
  importer of the Delta 4x4 products, that I got invested. That&rsquo;s when I decided to upgrade to a new Amarok. It
  still had four cylinders but had been updated in the form of new LED spotlights in the front. OCL came in as a sponsor
  to help me rebuild the car with the Delta 4x4 products, including a suspension lift kit, fender skirts, rims, side steps
  and a bullbar. The lights on my second Amarok came from the American company Vision X and was distributed by RindAB, who
  I got connected to at a car fair. The result was everything I had wished for and had seen other Amaroks have.</p>

  <p>To be really visible, I chose to wrap the whole car in a custom design. A theme inspired by the Volkswagen WRC car,
  but redesigned in order to avoid looking like a replica. For this I got the help of graphic artist and graffiti painter
  Gorm Boberg from Gothenburg who made the final design from my ideas. The actual wrapping work was done by Andreas at
  WrapZone. In my opinion, this was the coolest Amarok I had ever owned and I got a lot of attention in so many different
  places!</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>I was among the first Swedish customers to get an Amarok V6</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What was missing and finally updated on the Amarok was a 3-liter V6 engine, along with some other things. In
  addition, I was the first Swedish customer to pick up my Amarok at the factory in Hannover. From there, I drove straight
  down to Delta 4x4 outside Munich where they rebuilt it with the previously mentioned kit.</p>

  <p>This time I also updated the hatch for the truck bed to a Black Sheep Innovations one, providing smart storage
  compartments inside the door. Immediately when the modifications were complete, I drove up to the N&uuml;rburgring and
  took a couple of laps with the car on the North Loop. Without exaggerating, I can say that this was the first Amarok V6
  Delta 4x4 edition that had ever driven on the Loop.</p>

  <p>During my time as an Amarok owner, especially with the second and third one, I had a reoccurring problem. When people
  contacted me wanting to buy and make similar upgrades to their Amarok, it was hard to tell them where and who they could
  turn to do this kind of work. OCL Brorsson and RindaAB don&rsquo;t usually install their products for the end customer;
  they just made an exception for me. That&rsquo;s why, when I came in contact with Keltech in Enk&ouml;ping who had the
  competence for this type of job, it was a huge help for me.</p>

  <p>I finally found someone who could rebuild my cars and also take care of the people who contacted me wanting the same
  thing. I bought a new Amarok V6 and had it rebuilt. For various reasons, this was a disappointment and not what I hoped
  for. I can&rsquo;t say exactly why, because I don&rsquo;t want to call anyone out, but I&rsquo;ll just say it had to do
  with the way the wrapping and modifications were handled. Since then, a lot of things have changed and will not have to
  happen again. A longer article about this Amarok&nbsp;published earlier on Enliven <a
  href="https://www.enliven.co/stories/automotive/volkswagen-amarok-v6-delta-en-amarok-med-extra-allt">can be found
  here</a>.</p>

  <p>In the wake of the disappointment with my last Amarok V6 I had begun to glance at other brands. Of course it would
  have been awesome to get a full-size pickup like a Ram or an F-150, but that doesn&rsquo;t really work in a city like
  Stockholm. Especially when a guy like Daniel Helld&eacute;n gets to wreak havoc freely, who in all seriousness thinks
  that the future of vehicles is the bike... But let&rsquo;s not get off-topic because of this power-abusing maniac and
  stick to the subject.</p>

  <p>On a trip to Italy, with a mission to gather some more material to the book &quot;Gran Turismo &ndash; The Great Book
  About Italy&quot; which I made together with Peter Ternstr&ouml;m, I borrowed Gran Turismo Event&rsquo;s Mercedes G350.
  I had not only been in but also driven the G-Class before, but had not realized its value.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>​​​​​​​After 12 days on the Italian roads, my heart was sold&rdquo;​​​​​​​</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The comfort and wellbeing you experience in a Mercedes Gel&auml;ndewagen is very extraordinary and beyond the usual.
  However, it does come with some big problems if you are going to take pictures of it. One of them being the side-hinged
  hatch, making it more similar to a door, and therefore always in the way in one direction when opened.</p>

  <p>I was looking into buying the shorter convertible version, but with a starting price of about 75 000 &euro; for a
  used one, it wasn&rsquo;t optimal. A new G500 &quot;Finale Edition&quot; convertible would retail at about 350 000
  &euro;. So with those numbers in mind, and knowing that a car like that wouldn&rsquo;t be as easy to get as a work
  vehicle, I reluctantly realized that this was not how I would get to drive a car with a star in the front.</p>

  <p>Mercedes released the X-Class in 2017, initially equipped with a 2-liter diesel engine. I test drove this car myself
  but I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed. It was too similar to the Nissan Navara, which is the model the X-Class was based on.
  That&rsquo;s why the X-Class didn&rsquo;t feel like an interesting model at first. But when the V6 update came in 2018,
  something happened. Suddenly the X-Class got very interesting. You can read about my review of the X350 published on
  Enliven here. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>I started a dialogue with Mercedes Sweden, who weren&rsquo;t super excited since they had to prioritize other things
  over my idea for a collaboration. But after a long mail where I described my suggestion in-depth, underlining what I had
  to offer, the door opened a little bit. I was told that it would be a long process and that there wouldn&rsquo;t be a
  car available until the middle of the summer at best. That wasn&rsquo;t a problem for me of course, even though starting
  the Gran Turismo Events 2019-season in an X-Class would have been a dream come true.</p>

  <p>Then something happened at Mercedes, and suddenly everything just came together. I received an email about getting in
  touch with Sebastian Karlsson at Vehobil in Segeltorp, and two hours later I was standing there with a contract for a
  new X350 in my hand. The car was delivered three weeks later and was handled excellently by Sebastian!</p>

  <p>Casual yet elegant. No more words are really needed to describe the French fashion house Celine&#39;s autumn and

  the color choices, the combinations &mdash;&thinsp;everything breathes the 1970s, but the more stylish part of the
  decade&#39;s fashion image.</p>

  <p>Last year, Celine hired a new Creative Director in Hedi Slimane, who succeeded British Phoebe Philo. During her
  reign&nbsp;at Celine, she won much acclaim&nbsp;and love&nbsp;for her sparing and timeless design. It seems that Hedi,
  who in the role of Chief Designer at Saint Laurent made himself known for a much more challenging and rockier style, dug
  in the archives for the winter of 2019 when approaching&nbsp;the Celine customer.</p>

  <p>Below I have selected&nbsp;10 key garments and accessories from the catwalk, which can put a new flavor to your fall
  wardrobe, but above all can be there for a very long time. Similar garments are easy to find in with many other brands

  <p>Preparation time: 15-20 minutes (including&nbsp;5 minutes for preheating the oven)</p>

  <p>Baking time: around 75&nbsp;minutes, plus&nbsp;10-15 minutes for cooling (may vary depending on the oven type)</p>

  <p><br />
  <strong>Makes&nbsp;one loaf cake:</strong></p>

  <p>225 g self-raising wholemeal flour (you can substitute it with 225 g wholemeal flour + 12 g of baking powder)</p>

  <p>1/2 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg (it&#39;s more flavourful than nutmeg powder)</p>

  <p>80 grams of unsalted butter, cut into cubes</p>

  <p>70 grams of raw cane sugar</p>

  <p>zest of 1 unwaxed lemon</p>

  <p>3 over-ripened bananas, peeled and mashed</p>

  <p>2 large eggs at room temperature</p>

  <p>6 tablespoons of runny honey (if crystallised warm it in the microwave)</p>

  <p>50 grams of walnuts or pecans, chopped into small pieces and slightly roasted</p>

  <p><br />
  <strong>For the topping:</strong></p>

  <p>runny honey to drizzle on top</p>

  <p>30 g walnuts or pecans, chopped and lightly toasted</p>

  <p><br />
  <strong>Kitchenware:</strong></p>

  <p>a 900 grams or 2 lb loaf tin</p>

  <p>baking paper</p>

  <p>measuring scale</p>

  <p>a large mixing bowl and a spatula</p>

  <p>foil to cover the top of cake while baking</p>

  <p>a skewer to test the cake</p>

  <p>a bowl or a small pan to warm the honey</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>Preheat the oven to 175&nbsp;Celsius&nbsp;degrees and line the loaf tin with the baking paper.</p>

  <p>Sieve the flour and nutmeg together and then add the butter and mix it with your hands until the mixture begins to
  look like breadcrumbs. You can also use a food processor to do that but I find doing it by hands quite therapeutic!</p>

  <p>Mix in the lemon zest and the sugar. Fold in the bananas and eggs and mix everything until well combined.</p>

  <p>Pour the mixture into the lined tin and level the mixture with a spatula.</p>

  <p>Bake for 75 minutes in the center of a preheated oven at 175 Celsius degrees. Check the cake after 45 minutes, and
  cover the top with foil if it&#39;s browning too much.</p>

  <p>The cake is perfectly baked when a skewer inserted comes out clean. Once it&rsquo;s done, let it cool in the tin for
  10-15 minutes. Take it out from the tin and let it cool on the wire rack.</p>

  <p>For the topping, warm the honey in a small pan or microwave it for 10 to 20 seconds in a bowl and mix in the walnuts
  or pecans that you are using. Drizzle this on top of the loaf cake and enjoy it with your cuppa!</p>

  <p><strong>Some side notes:</strong></p>

  <p>The cake stays good for 2-3 days outside.<br />
  Maple syrup works well too and gives a distinct taste to the cake.<br />
  I have also baked this cake with a mix of wholemeal spelt and white spelt flour&nbsp;and it came out pretty well.</p>

  will delight in some of its fabulously chaotic markets.</p>

  <p>Southeast Asia is one of the most popular holiday destinations with its vibrant culture, iconic street food,
  world-renowned beaches and value for money attracting visitors from all over the world. But these destinations offer so
  much more outside of the popular and well-known locations where authentic food experiences can be discovered and
  enjoyed.</p>

  <p>The Southern Tourism Corridor is a tourism cooperation corridor among Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam established in
  2007, with Myanmar invited to join in August 2018. Phu Quoc Island is one&nbsp;of the Vietnamese provinces included to
  participate. I was invited by the Tourism Authority of Thailand to explore the corridor from a gastronomy perspective,
  and this was the last part of the trip.</p>

  <p>From Kampot in Cambodia (<a
  href="stories/gourmet-travel/feasting-beaten-track-cambodia-southeast-asia.html">read my previous
  article here</a>), I headed&nbsp;to the Prek Chak border, and crossed into Vietnam at the Xa Xia border. I stopped for a
  well-deserved and&nbsp;traditional Vietnamese lunch at The Sammy Hotel in Ha Tien, before heading to the Ha Tien Pier
  and board the Phu Quoc Express to Phu Quoc Island in Vietnam.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>It is at the markets where you will find the real Vietnam&rdquo; </em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Phu Quoc, Vietnam&rsquo;s biggest island, is just off the coast of Cambodia, with its twenty beaches&nbsp;mostly
  visited by local tourists. Dotted with beach resorts catering to all budgets, the gastronomy offer&nbsp;might not be the
  best example of traditional Vietnamese cuisine for foodies looking for the real experience.</p>

  <p>But it is at the markets where you will find the real Vietnam. Duong Dong is the largest town on the island, with a
  vibrant market to match. Located next to the river also called Duong Dong, the morning market offers the freshest
  produce, seafood, poultry and meat. Enjoy the sunrise reflecting on hundreds of fishing boats moored on the riverbank,
  followed by a walk down Nguyen Trung Truc Street, and take in the vibrancy and energy of the market as the sun rises.
  Just be careful of the motorbikes hooting at you to get out of their way if you walk too slow!</p>

  <p>The Cau Sau market is an evening market that sets up shop on one lane of the DT46 highway. This makes navigating the
  market even more trickier than usual, as cars speed past while locals on motorbikes stop to buy seafood, vegetables and
  snacks before jumping back on their motorbikes, heading home with their purchases. There is so much to take in and see
  but here you need to be aware of being in the way of motorbikes and cars.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>For a more tranquil experience head to the Truc Lam Ho Quoc Buddhist temple, climb to the top and enjoy a magical
  sunset with probably the best view in Phu Quoc. Or take the Hon Thom cable car to Pineapple Island and back. With its
  eight kilometers, this&nbsp;cable car is one of the longest&nbsp;in the world,&nbsp;and offers a breathtaking view of
  some of the twenty-eight&nbsp;islands that make up the Phu Quoc district.</p>

  <p>One of the most wonderful things in life is a chance to see something for the first time and even though Thailand,
  Cambodia and Vietnam are well-known destinations they offer so much more to see and taste when veering off the usual
  routes. Not only do you get to see something for the first time but you get to see and taste in a very authentic
  way.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking-gourmet-travel/feasting-beaten-track-vietnam-southeast-asia</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking-gourmet-travel/feasting-beaten-track-vietnam-southeast-asia</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 13:01:01 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Hein van Tonder</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Afro Indi Dandy]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>A story about romantic love and gentle masculinity.</p>

  <p>Prep, 1 hour<br />
  Cook, 40 min</p>

  <p>For 6 people</p>

  <p><strong>Dough</strong>:</p>

  <p>250 gr of semolina flour</p>

  <p>250 gr of durum wheat flour</p>

  <p>350 ml of warm water</p>

  <p>5 grams of brewer&#39;s yeast</p>

  <p>1 tbsp of olive oil&nbsp;</p>

  <p>2 teaspoons of salt</p>

  <p><strong>Filling</strong>:</p>

  <p>1 big aubergine</p>

  <p>1 kg of tomatoes&nbsp;</p>

  <p>4 garlic cloves finely chopped</p>

  <p>basil, finely chopped</p>

  <p>4 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p>1 tsp salt</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong></p>

  <p>Mix in the yeast with warm water and stir until it dissolves completely. Slowly pour in some of the water into the
  flour and start working with your hands. Add the rest of the water little by little and continue working the dough with
  your hands, folding into itself several times. Add the salt and fold several times. Then add the olive oil and keep
  working the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, and the olive oil is completely absorbed.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Put the dough into a large container, cover with cling film and let it rest overnight in a warm place. If you want a
  quicker process add in double the amount of yeast and let it rest for 2 hours or until it increases its size.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Take the dough out of the fridge, divide it into two small balls and let it rest for one hour.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Cook the filling:</strong></p>

  <p>Chop the aubergine into cubes of approximately 2 inches. Cook them in a pan for about 10 to 15 minutes with olive
  oil.</p>

  <p>Chop the tomatoes into cubes of approximately 1 inch and let them drain into a colander; then mix them in with the
  aubergine, garlic, basil, olive oil and salt in a separate container.</p>

  <p>Scatter some flour on a surface and flatten the two portions of dough separately with a rolling pin, to form two
  circles approximately double the size of your circular baking tray (I recommend you to work with a &Oslash;20 cm
  one).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Place your dough into the baking tray and put the tomatoes and aubergine mix inside. Bend the excess dough to cover
  the top, but not completely, leave a small hole.</p>

  <p>Cook at 220&deg;C&ensp;for 30 min, or until is golden. Take it out of the oven, spread some olive oil on the top with
  a brush&nbsp;and cook for another 5 min.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Let it rest for about 10 min before serving.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/prazzira-italian-vegetarian-pizza</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/prazzira-italian-vegetarian-pizza</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2019 14:00:01 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Jennifer Cauli</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Staircase]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Opening the gate to one of the majestuous buildings in Paris and going upstairs can take you to new, unknown

The last of the sour cherries from your tree, simmered
  in sugar, perked up with gin and made into a long, cool drink.  </p>

  <p>Cherries are only around for a fleeting moment. These sweet, poppable bursts of summer taste so glorious yet are so
  fiddly to eat that there is a kitchen gadget designed purely for getting rid of their sharp little stones.</p>

  <p>Unlike the dependable apples, oranges and bananas that fill my fruit bowl all year, these berries don&rsquo;t even
  make it out of their brown paper bag before I have stripped them of their sweet flesh, leaving nothing but those
  telltale stones rolling around in the corners.</p>

  <p>Halfway down my garden there is a cherry tree, but not of the sweet variety. These ones are sour cherries, posing
  prettily but as tart as bitter lemons. Until now I had always left them to the birds, but this year I leaned the ladder
  against the tree and harvested the final cupful of these lip-pursing fruits to see what could be made with them.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Drink under the cherry tree, and don&rsquo;t give the birds a single sip. They&rsquo;ve had enough</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Pies, cakes, frozen yogurts and brownies are all deliciously made with sour cherries, but with the sun hot overhead,
  it was this recipe for a tart Cherry Gin Rickey that spoke to me loudest...</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></p>

  <p>&bull; 1 cup pitted sour cherries</p>

  <p>&bull; &nbsp;half a cup of granulated sugar</p>

  <p>&bull; half a cup of water</p>

  <p>&bull; ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt</p>

  <p>&bull; half a cup of fresh lime juice (from 4 limes)</p>

  <p>&bull; half a cup of lemon-lime soft drink (such as Sprite)</p>

  <p>&bull; 4 ounces gin</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong><em>Methods</em></strong></p>

  <p>Pit the cherries and add them to a pan with the sugar, water and salt, and bring to a gentle boil. Keep an eye on it,
  stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened. This should take around 6 to 8 minutes.</p>

  <p>Cool completely, and then pour the mixture through a sieve into a bowl. Dispose of the cherries, keeping just the
  cherry syrup.</p>

  <p>Stir together the cherry syrup, lime juice, soft drink, and gin in a small pitcher. Pour evenly into 4 rocks glasses
  filled with crushed ice. Garnish with lime slices.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/drinks/sour-gin-rickey-garden-cocktail-cherry-tree</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/drinks/sour-gin-rickey-garden-cocktail-cherry-tree</guid><category><![CDATA[Drinks]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 08:34:18 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Kirstie Young</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fun Valley]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>This is a visual story about how dinosaurs, Chinese heavy industry and Egyptian children all have fun together in a
  tax-free zone by the Suez channel.</p>

  <p>TEDA is a major Chinese company, you may know it, but in case you don&rsquo;t then they have about $40 billion in
  assets and $11 billion in annual turnover. They trade heavily in Africa and have set up factories in the Suez Special
  Economic Zone (SEZONE) in Egypt.</p>

  <p>Getting interest from other companies to set up factories in the middle of nowhere is a challenge.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The existing plans had difficulty to get Egyptian workers to run the 24-hour shifts they do in China &ndash; this
  is where the fun starts</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Chinese state-owned company TEDA has started winning hearts and minds of Egypt&rsquo;s workers and children, and
  this seems to be the relatively strange logic they have to set up not one, but four theme parks inside the SEZONE under
  the name TEDA Fun Valley.</p>

  <p>The zone is right by the Suez Canal and about an hour and a half away from Cairo. There is Dinosaur World, Candy
  World, Water World, Automotive World and also (unsurprisingly) an Egyptian restaurant, as well as a Chinese restaurant,
  bank, swimming pool, basketball court and more.</p>

  <p>The backstory behind this is interesting as the driving force is economics, but not economics in the sense that
  revenue from the theme parks is the focus.</p>

  <p>Fun Valley is a story about China&rsquo;s involvement in Africa and how they are doing their own &ldquo;winning
  hearts and minds&rdquo; projects.</p>

  <p>Images of dinosaurs, Egyptian families and general theme-park oddness, are juxtaposed against the financial reality
  of Chinese soft propaganda.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>In the corporate material from TEDA they list the reason behind this&nbsp;as building smiles on Egyptian children
  in order to generate a prosperous future</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;A happy childhood lays a happy life, happy children will foster a happy society. TEDA Fun Valley cares the

Few are the dishes that don't
  have a whiff of parsley in them. Here we have paired it with lemon and chicken, a classic combination.</p>

  <p>For 4 servings&nbsp;</p>

  <p>500-600 g / 1.1-1.3 lb chicken, thighs, clubs and/or breasts&nbsp;</p>

  <p>1 big bunch of parsley, about 4-5 tbsp when chopped&nbsp;</p>

  <p>3-4 thick slices of lemon&nbsp;</p>

  <p>1 small onion&nbsp;</p>

  <p>1 clove of garlic&nbsp;</p>

  <p>salt&nbsp;</p>

  <p>black pepper</p>

  <p>3-4 tbs extra-virgin olive oil&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>Put the chicken pieces in a bowl. Chop the parsley, the onion and the garlic&nbsp;finely&nbsp;or
  run&nbsp;them&nbsp;in a blender.</p>

  <p>Quarter the lemon slices and mix these, salt, pepper and the parsley mix with olive oil, and add it to the
  chicken.</p>

  <p>Stir well before covering the bowl and putting it in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours. If you remember, stir now and
  then.</p>

  <p>Take the bowl out of the fridge to warm up the chicken to room temperature and then fry it in olive oil until golden
  and completely cooked. Serve with rice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/parsley-and-lemon-chicken</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/parsley-and-lemon-chicken</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2019 13:00:51 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Ilva Beretta</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Les frères sauvages]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Hints of summer fragrances have reached sunny shores in Cape Town.

  <p>Robin and Dimitri are two French brothers I had the pleasure to work with during their three-months staying in Cape

  <p>Dimitri, on the other hand, reached the most southern tip&nbsp;of the African continent just a few weeks after his

Enliven has tested this bestseller which has now made a comeback in
  Europe.</p>

  <p>First off, let&rsquo;s talk about the brand. The company was founded in the 1800s by Sakichi Toyoda, who built looms
  that revolutionized the Japanese textile industry. In 1933, the company started to manufacture passenger cars and later
  changed its name from Toyoda to Toyota. After World War II the brand became the largest in Japan and eventually
  established itself both in Europe and the United States. In 2018 Toyota was the world&#39;s second-largest automobile
  manufacturer after Volkswagen. In third place was Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi.</p>

  <p>The name Camry is a European phonetic interpretation of the Japanese word &#39;kanmuri&#39;&nbsp;which means
  &#39;crown&#39;. Originally, the name Camry was an add-on, intended for the four-door version of the Celica. The first
  Celica Camry entered a Japanese Toyota Corolla store in 1980. The first generation of Camry, on the other hand, appeared
  in 1982 when it started retailing in Japan. With 700 000 copies sold annually, the Camry holds the title of the
  best-selling sedan in the world. In total, 19 million units are distributed between 100 different car markets. The Camry
  has not been sold in Europe for 15 years, but now it is back.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The name Camry is a European phonetic interpretation of the Japanese word &#39;kanmuri&#39;, which means
  &#39;crown&#39;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Camry belongs to the larger sedan segment. For example, the trunk of 524 liters is actually bigger than that of a
  Volvo S90. The driver&rsquo;s seat has a low seating position with plenty of space, even when leaving more than enough
  room for a passenger in the back. The design of the dash and controls is sharp, as always it comes to Japanese car
  brands, and with slightly different lines than we are accustomed to in Europe. There is absolutely nothing negative
  about that but if you&rsquo;re used to a car like an Audi, BMW or Mercedes, where this type of line selection does not
  occur, you might need some time to adjust. The interior material choices will not be quite as high-end as the
  aforementioned brands, but the quality is still there, especially in the leather seats.</p>

  <p>If you choose the premium package that costs 25 000 SEK more, you get an adjustable back seat, a sound system from
  JBL, sun protection curtains for side and rear panels and a heads-up display. With all these additions, the Camry
  actually feels quite luxurious. One major drawback, however, is that the new Camry does not support Apple CarPlay.
  However, Toyota themselves say that this is only a matter of time.</p>

  <p>When it comes to driving, it takes some time to get used to the CVT-gearbox, something we have mentioned earlier here
  at Enliven. It is a step-less transmission, commonly seen in mopeds. Thanks to the acceleration torque, the car is
  changing gears steplessly. If you are not used to that, it feels like you are constantly revving the engine. When you do
  get used to it, however, it feels relatively harmonious and as long as you don&rsquo;t floor it, the Camry will be able
  to get a mileage of about 0,5l/10km. In addition, the new Camry has a hybrid mode, meaning that when starting the car
  and while driving at low speeds, the car is silently powered by electricity.</p>

  <p>It is yet to be determined if the new Camry becomes a bestseller. However, it will probably fit perfectly in the taxi
  business, where the greatest source of interest in this model will likely be.<br />

  dinner, and despite the language barrier, he did.</p>

  <p>1 large onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p>10 cm of lemongrass stalk, finely sliced</p>

  <p>a large knob of ginger, grated</p>

  <p>3 large cloves of garlic, peeled</p>

  <p>2 tsp of freshly grated turmeric</p>

  <p>4 chicken thighs, bone-in, skin on</p>

  <p>4 leaves of kaffir lime</p>

  <p>1 litre of boiling water</p>

  <p>1 tbsp of fish sauce</p>

  <p>1 tbsp of lime juice</p>

  <p>Place the lemongrass, ginger, garlic and turmeric in a pestle and mortar and pound to a paste.</p>

  <p>Heat the oil and add this paste together with the onion,&nbsp;and fry over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Add
  then&nbsp;the chicken portions and coat with the onion mix.</p>

  <p>Add the lime leaves and the boiling water, and simmer with the lid slightly ajar for 45 minutes. After that, remove
  the chicken and let it cool for about 10 minutes.</p>

  <p>With your hands,&nbsp;remove the meat from the bones and flake into smaller pieces. Place the&nbsp;flaked chicken
  back in the pot.</p>

  <p>Add the fish sauce, lime juice and sugar and bring the soup back to the boil. Reduce the heat, add the coconut milk
  and simmer for 10 minutes. Check the seasoning and add more salt or sugar as required.</p>

  <p>Serve the soup hot, garnished with salad onion and coriander.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking-gourmet-travel/khmer-chicken-soup</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking-gourmet-travel/khmer-chicken-soup</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 13:00:12 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Hein van Tonder</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Summer in the City]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>About last summer in Soho…</p>

  <p>250 g / 9 oz chickpea flour</p>

  <p>500 ml / 2,1 cup water</p>

  <p>0,5 - 1 tsp salt</p>

  <p>250 g / 9 oz sliced zucchini</p>

  <p>Put the sliced zucchini in a bowl and mix with 1 tbs olive oil.</p>

  <p>Take an oven-proof form (I use a 22 x 30 cm / 8.6 x 11.8 in), preferable a non-stick on -&nbsp;the important thing is
  that it&#39;s big enough to make the farinata no more than 1 cm / 0.4 in thick. Drizzle olive oil in it, greasing the
  surfaces well.</p>

  <p>Pour the batter into the tray and&nbsp;distribute the zucchini over - don&rsquo;t worry if it looks too much, the
  slices will shrink drastically in the oven.</p>

  <p>Drizzle more olive oil over, sprinkle salt and bake in a pre-heated oven (225 &deg;C / 435 &deg;F) for 15 to 20
  minutes until it&#39;s golden and has a crispy bottom.</p>

Despite there being two
  <span class="caps">AMG</span> models with more horsepower, the <span class="caps">CLA</span> 250 does its job very well.
  Enliven was present at the test run in Germany.</p>

  <p>The race between car companies to present the sportiest and most performance-filled cars never seems to cease.
  Mercedes Benz is certainly no exception, which in many cases has been a leader in this area. The CLA model was presented
  in 2013 and was a sedan version of the A-class, a model with a story that deserves its own article. The Shooting Break
  version of the CLA was introduced in 2015 and this year it&#39;s time for the upgrade to generation two.</p>

  <p>The new generation has got a more mature look. All the details have been refined and now feel more perfect. One
  especially large change is the rear, with new slimmer lights and better design than the previous generation. The front
  also has the new design and the grill, now tilted slightly forward, gives the car a more aggressive look.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>This is a car that makes you smile</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The color combination of black and orange makes the test car extra eye-catching and is appropriately named
  &quot;Edition Orange Art&quot;. The front and back bumpers as well as the rims are outlined in orange. All the interior
  seams are orange, and so are some of the details on the dashboard. Extremely tasteful and gives the car a sporty and
  cool look!</p>

  <p>The above-mentioned color combination is not the only thing that contributes to the sporty attitude. The big wheels,
  the side steps and most of all the alcantara seats all say a lot about what this car has to offer. When you get in the
  CLA 250 and close the door it is like closing the zipper of a tailor-made biker leather jacket. The car door windows of
  the CLA 250 are rather small, but do not impair your vision from the driver&rsquo;s seat. Everything is close together
  without feeling cramped. The back seat of the CLA 250 is surprisingly spacious despite its format.</p>

  <p>The CLA 250 engine can produce 211 horsepower. As mentioned above, there are already two AMG versions of the CLA, 35
  and 45, where the CLA 45 has an incredible 421 horses. They all have four-wheel drive. But let us get back to the car we
  are talking about. The number of horsepowers can be blinding, but do you really need that much power in such a small
  car? The answer is naturally subjective.</p>

  <p>What we can say after a day with the CLA 250, however, is that this is a car that makes you smile. It is incredibly
  fun to drive and literally feels like a small go-kart. It is very easily handled thanks to its format and the four-wheel
  drive. If you engage sport mode, a damper opens, making the growl of the engine extra loud. Sitting behind the wheel
  driving down the winding roads of southern Germany is an amazing feeling. Bearing today&rsquo;s experience in mind, it
  can only be said that the CLA 250 is a fantastic car that is suitable for your everyday commute as well as your weekend
  cruising. We promise to return with a test drive on both the A 35 and the CLA 45 soon, but until then, the CLA 250 is
  more than enough.</p>

The
  world's most important food photography competition takes place in Padstow, well known for the many establishments of
  celebrity chef and restaurateur, Rick Stein.</p>

  <p>Having watched a few of his cooking shows over the years, it was quite a treat to spend time in the village and taste
  a sample&nbsp;of his restaurants, deli and bakery. From what I have read his presence has not been without controversy,
  with the town now often referred to as Padstein. There have also been incidents of damage to his establishments, often
  thought to have been caused by disgruntled residents.</p>

  <p>Our first stop was Stein&rsquo;s Deli,&nbsp;stocking pastries, chocolates, biscuits, baked goods, cheeses, loads of
  pantry items and a good selection of crockery and kitchen tools. Most of them are sold under the brand&nbsp;Rick Stein,
  while some candles and soaps are branded under Jill Stein, his ex-wife. I visited the deli around 5 pm, just in time to
  get leftover pastries and bread at half price. The haddock pastry was delicious, and I also stocked up on some Cornish
  sea salt&nbsp;and some local chili sauces.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>It has been&nbsp;worth noting the strong sense of support for&nbsp;local artisans and farmers in all the products
  carried here</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Next to the deli is Stein&rsquo;s Fish &amp; Chips. A queue was building for the 5 pm opening time. All the items on
  the menu are grilled or fried in beef drippings (so good!), and it is also possible to order a meal cooked with
  gluten-free batter. The batter on our goujons was super crisp, the onion rings were top notch and the Rick Stein-labeled
  wine paired perfectly.</p>

  <p>A walk through the village the next morning led us to Stein&rsquo;s Bakery, brimming with bakes, pasties,
  pastries&nbsp;and mountains of meringues. Not far away&nbsp;is Stein&rsquo;s Gift Shop, a&nbsp;retail outlet for all
  things Rick Stein: crockery, kitchenware, souvenirs, gadgets and Rick Stein cookbooks.
  Nearby&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;Cookery School, which offers courses between several hours long to some 4-day
  extravaganzas. We walked away with a beautiful serving bowl that I can not wait to use &ndash; and photograph.</p>

  <p>Next to the deli is&nbsp;Rick Stein&rsquo;s&nbsp;Fishmongers, where you can purchase a range of fish and shellfish to
  cook at home. Adjacent to the fishmonger is a small oyster bar where you can taste some delicious moules
  marini&egrave;re, cooked in front of you while you sit&nbsp;at the counter.&nbsp;There are various options from seafood
  platters to champagne and oysters, to satisfy all appetites and budgets.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The service made us feel walking into a business where people enjoy what they do, with gracious&nbsp;hospitality
  at each of these establishments</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Our last Rick Stein taster was a prix fixe lunch at St Petroc&rsquo;s, a bistro with ten bedrooms&nbsp;decorated by
  Jill, where we had a starter of fish cakes with&nbsp;a tartare sauce that was really superb. The hake main course was
  perfectly cooked, and the melanzane was packed with rich&nbsp;tomato flavors.</p>

  <p>There have been lots said about the massive presence Rick Stein has in the town. As an outsider who only spent three
  days in the area, I can&rsquo;t really have an opinion, but it has been&nbsp;worth noting the strong sense of support
  for&nbsp;local artisans and farmers in all the products carried here. The service made us feel walking into a business
  where people enjoy what they do, and the&nbsp;hospitality experienced at each of his establishments was gracious and
  friendly, with each member of staff committed to assisting at all times. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>But Padstow has much more on offer than just Rick Stein&rsquo;s&nbsp;establishments. We also&nbsp;had a fantastic
  lunch at Barnaby&rsquo;s, sister restaurant to Prawn on the Lawn, featuring wood-fired sharing plates with a strong
  emphasis on Middle Eastern and Northern African flavors, which we love. The dessert was so good too - a spiced quince
  cheesecake made with thick, delicious Cornish cream, for a&nbsp;rich and&nbsp;memorable ending. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;also
  available as an ice cream, so make sure you get a scoop or two when you visit!</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/lunch-rick-stein-padstow-england</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/lunch-rick-stein-padstow-england</guid><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Hein van Tonder</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pastoral Kitchen — A Dark Tale]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Not everything is what it seems. Not as innocent as she looks to her masters. Revenge is sweet. </p>

  <p>The Lady of the house was not well. She had been ailing for eighteen months. Her doctors were mystified. Her husband,
  quietly terrified.</p>

  <p>The kitchen staff had been instructed to prepare only the most thoughtful of menus. Everything had to revolve around
  the health of&nbsp;her ladyship. Nothing left to chance.&nbsp;<br />
  And so Wendolyn, the cook-apprentice, searched the forest every day for fungus, roots, and fruits. She had been taught
  what&nbsp;was good to eat, and what was not.<br />
  <br />
  Her mother, the head housekeeper, had schooled her. Wendolyn would never forget the day she died, from asthma,
  slumped&nbsp;beside the laundry basket. But Wendolyn had to mourn on her own time; there was housework to be
  done.&nbsp;<br />
  That was two years ago. Now she worked late each night, preparing special recipes just for her ladyship. And yet things
  did not&nbsp;improve; instead, the woman only grew more ill.<br />
  <br />
  One day, a request came from upstairs. Her ladyship was coming to the end of her life. She had asked for dark-cherry
  pie,&nbsp;her favorite, one last time. So Wendolyn prepared it with great care. She tasted its juicy sweetness, before
  adding the final ingredient,&nbsp;a secret one, just for her ladyship: small, ground flakes of Destroying Angel, the
  most poisonous of mushrooms. Wendolyn had been mixing it&nbsp;into her ladyship&#39;s meals for eighteen months. Slowly,
  gently, deliciously killing off her organs.<br />
  <br />
  Her ladyship, who had worked Wendolyn&#39;s mother to an early grave. Her ladyship, who had beaten a weeping
  Wendolyn&nbsp;and called her a &#39;stupid little peasant&#39;. A peasant, perhaps, but little no more and as it turned
  out, not so stupid after all.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/art/pastoral-kitchen-dark-tale</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/art/pastoral-kitchen-dark-tale</guid><category><![CDATA[Contemporary Art]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 14:00:13 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Russell Smith, Jonathan Bain</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Finding Trails in Engelberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Running in the Alps doesn't necessarily mean that you have to turn your lungs inside out to breath. With the cable
  cars in Engelberg, you will reach the mountainsides with still enough energy to admire the view.</p>

  <p>After running the trail from Bergrestaurant F&uuml;renalp towards Engelberg for approximately 3,5 kilometers the
  landscape opens up. I&rsquo;ve reached the end of the forest that has been around me for the last&nbsp;kilometer. The
  conifers are replaced with alpine meadow and the view over Engelberg village is stunning. Too mesmerized of what&rsquo;s
  in front of me I stop, remove my sunglasses and just keep&nbsp;standing on the trail, watching the sun setting behind
  the mountains on the other side of the valley.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>My trip to Engelberg this time has one goal:&nbsp;to explore and experience the summer trails</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Before leaving Sweden to travel to Switzerland I come to the conclusion that few people know the trails better than
  Thomas Infanger, the hotel manager at Trail Hotel Engelberg. I book an appointment with him at his hotel.</p>

  <p>We meet and I ask him about where to run. He unfolds a couple of maps on the table in front of me, and points at
  them. Born and raised in Engelberg and a passionate trail runner, he&nbsp;tells me which cable cars to use and which
  trails have the best view over the valley. I listen carefully, trying to memorize as much as possible. We agree to run
  together for a couple of hours at Brunni two days later. I say goodbye to the very kind and helpful Thomas. I&#39;m
  looking forward to meeting him soon.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the gods of the weather are not with us&nbsp;when we meet at the bottom of the cable car up to Brunni.
  It&rsquo;s foggy and some light rain comes in the air. Thomas is still happy and that makes my mood better. We enter the
  big cable car and run the trails we have planned. When reaching the top, Thomas tells me about this area where we are
  moving along the trials. He talks about his childhood in the mountains and about his hotel, which has been in the family
  for a while. When we finish&nbsp;running, we end the morning session with a coffee at Brunnih&uuml;tte, before leaving
  the mountain with the cable car.</p>

  <p>The day after I have a new guide on the mountain. The Swede Stefan Brunqvist, manager at Spannort Inn, promises me to
  show me all the good stuff next to Tr&uuml;bsee, at the Titlis-side of the valley. In the evening, when heading down
  again, I can say that&nbsp;he sure has kept his promise. Satisfied with what I&rsquo;ve been able to experience in the
  mountains for the last couple of days, I return to Spannort Inn. I am exhausted, and I fall asleep immediately.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/trekking/finding-trails-engelberg</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/trekking/finding-trails-engelberg</guid><category><![CDATA[Trekking]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2019 13:00:56 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Axel Adolfsson</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Monk-Berry Fizz]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>A handcrafted and double-distilled gin using a hybrid artisanal still, called ‘Jennifer’ after one of its creator's

  sunroom and a pool. The Wittzells have created a cozy home with their two daughters.</p>

  <p>What is now a small suburb to Lund used to be the location of five homesteads in the mid-to-late 17th century, one of
  which the Wittzell&acute;s are currently living in.</p>

  <p>&ndash; Today, three of the homesteads remain. Two of them have unfortunately been demolished and replaced by new
  houses. Even though it has been subject to some rough renovations over the years, ours is one of the most well-kept,
  Anna says.</p>

  <p>Among other things, the old front door was torn down, the windows and floors were replaced, the original kitchen was
  removed, and the old iron furnace was replaced by a modern one. Beams and panels in the ceiling remained, as did the
  original floor plan.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; When initializing the construction, we chose a contractor who accepted that some things were yet to be
  determined, granting us the ability to stay flexible during the process. We were also able to stay in the small
  homestead while the main house underwent the construction. Being on maternity leave, I was always able to keep my eye on
  the carpenters. It also gave us the liberty to make decisions and changes along the way, </em>Anna explains.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em></em><em>When the family bought the house in 2008, the sun room was luckily still intact and well-kept</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>From the old homestead, the family built a passage that turned into a front hallway. The ground floor of the new
  building contains a kitchen, a side entrance, a laundry room and a bathroom, while the second floor has four bedrooms
  and a smaller bathroom.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; Meanwhile, the flexibility when building meant that some things would slip between the cracks. One
  example is the mishap of the kitchen plan, where we didn&rsquo;t account for the space needed by the outlet of the
  wooden stove. Changing the blueprint last minute, a wall that was moved made space for an extra shelf dedicated to oils,
  herbs, tools et cetera. Considering the result, that shelf is one of the best features of the kitchen.</em></p>

  <p>Anna explains that the unusually large kitchen was a conscious decision that proved to be a very fortunate one,
  seeing as the kitchen is the place where the family spends most of their time together.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; This is where everyone wants to play, do arts and crafts, do homework &ndash; and cook obviously. When we
  have company over, the kitchen is always the most popular place. The living room, as opposed to the kitchen, is very
  small, but we always intended it to be that way. We have never regretted that.</em></p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Building a pool is the best investment we have made, it provides a lovely feeling of vacation from May to
  September</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Anna says that she has expressed herself creatively for as long as she can remember. She always liked to rearrange
  her furniture, draw and do arts and crafts.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; I like making new uses for old things. That also makes me a bit of a hoarder, because everything can come
  in handy&rdquo;or I&acute;ll think I&acute;m going to make something out of this later,</em>she says laughing.</p>

  <p>She describes the interior as an updated Carl Larsson style, referring to the wooden chairs and the woven runner rugs
  that they like to put together with more modern furniture and details.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; We&rsquo;re just mixing together everything we like, for example industrial -I LOVE metal cabinets&ndash;
  a sheepskin, a modern flowerpot, a piece of furniture from the 60s, a wax tablecloth, heirlooms and so on. We simply buy
  things we like, using our gut, and it turns into a mix of everything. I do however like to maintain a uniform color
  palette that keeps everything together.</em></p>

  <p>She describes the interior as something that has developed over the years and is constantly changing. Everything is
  assigned its place because it fits right there and then. Like when the kids enter an arts and crafts faze and there is a
  need for something to store all the supplies in &ndash; one piece of furniture has to take place for another.</p>

  <p><em>&ndash; I can&#39;t remember ever thinking &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go buy some new furniture&rdquo;.&nbsp; Instead,
  it&rsquo;s the house conforming because a new piece is introduced, bought from a flea market or some clearance sale. By
  the way, I love discounts. I think the only thing we have ever bought at full price is the kitchen table and the lights
  above it - and our beds, </em>Anna concludes.</p>

  35 g (1/2 cup) of grated Pecorino, Grana Padano, Gruy&egrave;re or Parmesan cheese<br />
  3 egg yolks<br />
  salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />
  1 litre (4 cups) of&nbsp;milk<br />
  1 ml (1/4 teaspoon) of ground nutmeg<br />
  200 g (1 2/3 cup) of semolina flour</p>

  <p><strong>Sauce</strong></p>

  <p>60 g of melted butter<br />
  125 ml (1/2 cup) of fresh cream<br />
  35 g (1/2 cup) of grated Pecorino, Grana Padano, Gruy&egrave;re or Parmesan cheese<br />
  80 g of pancetta&nbsp;sliced into small pieces<br />
  300 g mushrooms, broken into smaller pieces if very large<br />
  olive oil for frying<br />
  salt and freshly ground pepper<br />
  a few sprigs of thyme</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>Start with the gnocchi. Line a 30 x 25 x 2 cm baking tray with non-stick baking paper.</p>

  <p>In a mixing bowl, whisk the butter, cheese and yolks, season generously and set aside.</p>

  <p>Heat the milk in a large saucepan, add the nutmeg and season. When the milk starts to boil, add the semolina while
  stirring.</p>

  <p>Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook while stirring, until the mixture thickens and pulls away from the
  sides. Remove from the heat, add the yolks and cheese mixture and mix until well combined.</p>

  <p>Transfer the mixture to the baking tray, edging it into the corners and smoothing the surface to an even thickness,
  using a spatula dipped in cold water. Set aside to cool completely.</p>

  <p>Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C and grease a 25 x 18 x 5 cm baking dish.</p>

  <p>Fry the pancetta in a pan until it gets crispy and the fat has been released. Remove with a slotted spoon, add the
  mushrooms and fry them,&nbsp;adding more oil if needed, until just cooked.</p>

  <p>Spoon the pancetta and mushrooms in the bottom of the baking dish (reserving a few for garnish).</p>

  <p>Turn the semolina slab out of the tray onto a clean working surface and peel off the baking paper. Cut the slab into
  whichever shapes you like (squares, triangles...). Arrange the cut shapes, slightly overlapping on top of the
  mushrooms.</p>

  <p>Drizzle the butter and cream over the gnocchi and sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 25-30 minutes until they are golden
  and bubbly. Reheat the&nbsp;reserved mushrooms and serve them&nbsp;as a garnish.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/gnocchi-alla-romana</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/gnocchi-alla-romana</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2019 12:59:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Hein van Tonder</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coconut and Lime Tres Leches Cake]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>A delicious zesty take on the classic sponge cake soaked in three types of milk, adapted from Delicious

  <p>We all need to sustain a certain amount of fluids in our body to feel good, whether it&rsquo;s water, coffee or other
  interesting beverages. This is a short guide to where you get the best of what&rsquo;s what.<br />
  &nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>Coffee</strong></em>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The coffee revolution came slowly but surely to Sweden, as we are coffee-loving people, pretty&nbsp;set in our
  way&nbsp;of drinking it: preferably strong and not very fancy. The most common coffee joke in Sweden tells about the
  woman who goes abroad and brings her own Swedish coffee - that gives you a hint. Let me introduce you to some of my
  favorite places...</p>

  <p>Sosta</p>

  <p>For a classic Italian espresso. You find them on&nbsp;Sveav&auml;gen, where you will&nbsp;also get the real feeling
  with the old Italian cabdrivers hanging out on their brake.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sosta.se">sosta.se</a></p>

  <p>Drop Coffee</p>

  <p>For the nouveau&nbsp;trendy hipster coffee, right on S&ouml;dermalm. Drop Coffee was part of the first wave of coffee
  nerdiness to really hit Stockholm and has stayed on point. It doesn&#39;t get any better and still&nbsp;they also do
  excellent cold brews.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropcoffee.com">dropcoffee.com</a></p>

  <p>The Mega Caf&eacute;</p>

  <p>A&nbsp;newcomer on the scene, with an&nbsp;Australian owner who previously brewed in Paris before opening in
  S&ouml;dermalm. The coffee here is of the highest quality!&nbsp;<a
  href="https://themegacafe.wordpress.com">themegacafe.wordpress.com</a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>Wine</strong></em></p>

  <p>Stockholmers don&#39;t make it only by coffee - of course we love wine as well. There&nbsp;are so many choices right
  now, with wine bars popping up&nbsp;all over the town like mushrooms. I have a few favorites for sure, places where I
  find amazing&nbsp;wine and&nbsp;great staff, where you will feel instantly welcome whether you are a novice or an
  expert. Or something in between.</p>

  <p>Grus Grus</p>

  <p>It really is a place with&nbsp;something for everyone, whether you are conventional, traditional or more of a
  nontraditionalist wine drinker: this is for you!&nbsp;<a
  href="http://grusgrusvinbaren.se/en/home/">grusgrusvinbaren.se</a></p>

  <p>Tyge and Sessil</p>

  <p>Opened by famed chef and restaurateur Niklas Ekstedt, there is a strict natural wine policy;&nbsp;this is for the
  wine lover who prefers his or her wine&nbsp;made&nbsp;in an amphora. The place is always buzzing and sommelier
  Maximilian&nbsp;Mellfors has truly created a wine list with the best of both new and old-world rarities.&nbsp;<a
  href="https://tygesessil.se">tygesessil.se</a></p>

  <p>Ambar</p>

  <p>This little gem on a calm street in a nontrendy part of town is truly a great hideout. With its&nbsp;carefully
  selected wines, amazing sak&eacute; and&nbsp;good beers it is truly worth a visit. And it&#39;s&nbsp;not to hard to
  spend a long night.&nbsp;<a href="https://ambarvinbar.se">ambarvinbar.se</a></p>

  <p>Savant Bar</p>

  <p>Almost in the city center you will find this relatively new little wine bar.&nbsp;Marcus has created&nbsp;a haven for
  lovers of great wines from around the world, some of them relatively rare. He also&nbsp;serves&nbsp;by the glass! Go and
  treat yourself.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.savantbar.com">savantbar.com</a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>Beer</strong></em></p>

  <p>Yes, also beer, just because. If you are a beer lover there are a plethora of different places to hang out at.</p>

  <p>Akkurat</p>

  <p>For the truly nerdy, amazing array of hard-to-find sours and lambic ales, and of course their own limited beers. Here
  you will feel truly at home with the other beer aficionados but also fit right in even if you only want a tasty
  lager.&nbsp;<a href="https://akkurat.se">akkurat.se</a></p>

  <p>Omnipollos Hatt</p>

  <p>Henok Fentie makes beer for everyone, but mostly for the more adventurous. This little microbrewery in the heart of
  S&ouml;dermalm makes beer that makes you think, and hopefully drink. Why not try the Elsa next time you stop by? It
  is&nbsp;a sour make with acai, goji and blueberries.&nbsp;<a
  href="http://www.omnipolloshatt.com">omnipolloshatt.com</a></p>

  <p>Omnipollo Flora</p>

  <p>Of&nbsp;course there has to be a beer garden on the list. Omnipollo Hatt has moved in the city center and charms even
  the most stubborn pilsner&nbsp;drinker. Come enjoy the sun and why not a pitcher of AON, a vanilla-soaked French toast
  imperial stout.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.omnipollosflora.com">omnipollosflora.com</a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>Booze</strong></em></p>

  <p>Yes. Cocktails that tickle your fancy. There is a myriad of places in town as the bar scene with specialty cocktails
  has&nbsp;been booming for quite some time.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Bar Hommage</p>

  <p>in this little gem of a cocktail bar the drinks almost have a&nbsp;spiritual feel; they are carefully selected to fit
  perfectly with the food and deliver the experience of a very interesting&nbsp;dinner. Find your favorite
  amongst&nbsp;the many signature cocktails named after the streets of Stockholm.&nbsp;<a
  href="http://bar-hommage.com">bar-hommage.com</a></p>

  <p>Tjoget</p>

  <p>Here you can hang out in the true former working-class area of Hornstull, and enjoy the savoir-faire&nbsp;of their
  talented and hardworking bartenders. Don&#39;t leave before you try their Passionfruit Negroni Shakerato!&nbsp;<a
  href="https://tjoget.com">tjoget.com</a></p>

  <p>Cadier Bar</p>

  <p>And of course there has to be something for the hotel bar aficionado. The Cadier Bar in the famous&nbsp;Grand Hotel
  recently went under&nbsp;a makeover, but is still keeping&nbsp;its air of luxury and comfort. Sit in their big velvety
  chairs and enjoy a&nbsp;world-class cocktail&nbsp;prepared by some of the best bartenders in Sweden.&nbsp;<a

  <p>Peas and beans are super-crops that seemingly have everything &ndash; good for the environment, easy to grow and
  nutritious.&nbsp;Give them extra space in this year&#39;s kitchen-garden!&nbsp;Properly cultivated, they become a
  decorative highlight - and there are lots of fun varieties to choose from!</p>

  <p>In the kitchen garden at Fredriksdal&#39;s open-air museum in Helsingborg, the summer harvest is planned long before
  spring is over.&nbsp;The vegetables grown here are often old&nbsp;varieties&nbsp;with an exciting history.&nbsp;And the
  gardener, Philippe H&auml;sslekvist, is particularly fond of peas and beans.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Legumes belong to an exciting plant family and deserve some attention - few other species have so many
  benefits</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Almost fifty kinds of legumes are grown here; a display of their abundance of variety.&nbsp;Above all, there are
  different garden beans; snap beans, wax beans, string beans and common beans. The main focus is Nordic classics such as
  brown beans and forgotten local varieties such as&nbsp;Gotland&#39;s&nbsp;speckled bean and &ldquo;Gnesta&#39;s
  Favourite&rdquo;.&nbsp;But he also cultivates European varieties, such as French gourmet beans and Italian cooking
  beans.</p>

  <p><em>-I am passionate about diversity.&nbsp;You don&#39;t just have one kind of bean, you have many!</em></p>

  <p>Fredriksdal&#39;s kitchen-garden has been recreated according to the prevailing style of the 1850s and right beside
  it is the manor from the late 18th century.&nbsp;At that time, the garden&#39;s main task was to provide both men and
  women with fruit, berries and vegetables. The occupant families were well traveled, and the gardeners of various estates
  and farms in Europe often exchanged plants and seeds with each other.&nbsp;This made for richness in variety already
  back then.</p>

  <p>Above all, the kitchen-garden&#39;s function was to produce large amounts of food.&nbsp;Today, we also want it to be
  a beautiful part of the outdoor environment.&nbsp;And many of the historic peas and beans are truly
  spectacular.&nbsp;They vary widely in color and shape.&nbsp;The pods can be yellow, violet, streaky, green&hellip; Some
  are several decimeters long, for example the Golden Gate one.&nbsp;Others are short and saber-shaped.&nbsp;And then of
  course you also have lovely flower beans!</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>There are so many colorful varieties: yellow Neckargold, green Cobra, violet Blauhilde...</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Giant beans that easily grow over three meters tall are a spectacular feature of the kitchen garden.&nbsp;They need
  good support to climb on, preferably long cabers.&nbsp;At Fredriksdal, Italian Borlotto and French Flageolette beans
  hang down&nbsp;from several meters high&nbsp;&ldquo;wigwams&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>Equally tall are the flower beans, or rose beans as they are also called.&nbsp;They were brought to Europe after
  Columbus&#39; discovery of South America in the late 15th century and are wonderfully beautiful with flowers in white,
  red, pink and a mix of both.</p>

  <p><em>-And they should not just be grown as decoration, because they taste as good as they look</em>, Philippe
  insists.</p>

  <p>Among the flower beans, Painted&nbsp;Lady&nbsp;is a real heritage variety, with mixed flowers in light red and
  white.&nbsp;It has allegedly been cultivated since the 16th century but is only formally documented since 1855. Even the
  flowers are edible and go well in salads, and the immature pods are eaten as&nbsp;haricots verts.</p>

  <p>Another fun way to grow beans is to let them climb on arches.&nbsp;At Fredriksdal, several different types form a
  whole tunnel of tall varieties in different colors: the yellow Neckargold, green Cobra, and the violet Blauhilde&nbsp;to
  name a few.&nbsp;A white-painted garden statue completes the picture.</p>

  <p>As a climbing support you can also use bare birches where the branches are cut down to short stumps; otherwise
  ordinary bamboo sticks will do just fine.&nbsp;A more original way is to place a skimmer at the top of a cane and from
  there let the cords run down to the ground. The beans climb vigorously, and come summer, it will have become a proper
  feature of the garden!</p>

  <p>Broad beans, which are their own group of beans, have characteristic plumpness to their growth.&nbsp;Among them is
  the special English variety Chrimson&nbsp;Flowered,&nbsp;from 1778.&nbsp;For a long time it existed only as privately
  owned and was grown within the same family for hundreds of years.&nbsp;Before the last branch of the family died, some
  seeds were donated to&nbsp;Kew&nbsp;Garden in London where it is still sold.&nbsp;More common varieties are White Emergo
  and Painted Lady. Peas also belong to the legume family and among them there are both sugar peas from the late 1800s and
  traditional field peas with purple flowers and violet&nbsp;pods.</p>

  <p>Fredriksdal was originally built as an estate for Fredrik Wilhelm&nbsp;C&ouml;ster;&nbsp;a summer place near the city
  but with all the pleasures of rural life.&nbsp;The last private owner lived until 1916, after which the park and garden
  were donated to Helsingborg&#39;s city to become a museum to enjoy and learn from.&nbsp;The condition was that the place
  be preserved in its original condition - and so it is.</p>

  <p>It is not at all difficult to imagine anyone in the basket chair on the manor&#39;s porch, with a&nbsp;kitchen cloth
  on their lap and a basket of beans to rinse before the men sit down to eat.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Background</strong></em></p>

  <p>The garden bean, P.&nbsp;vulgaris, originates in South America, where it has been cultivated for at least 8000
  years.</p>

  <p>The Spanish brought the bean to Europe in the early 16th century.&nbsp;It was first in the 1820s that the first,
  low-growing, beans were traded. They were green and often violet-spotted; the yellow wax bean came first around
  1830.</p>

  <p><em><strong>To grow beans</strong></em></p>

  <p>Beans have the special ability to create their own fertilizer by absorbing nitrogen from the air.&nbsp;Therefore,
  they can often be grown on nitrogen-depleted soils.&nbsp;The beans thrive in molten, water-bearing, lighter
  soil.&nbsp;All forms of beans, except the broad bean, require quite a lot of heat and cannot withstand
  frost.&nbsp;Hence, choose a warm and protected spot for cultivation.&nbsp;Can be sown at 15 degrees of soil temperature,
  right when spring has properly sprung.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/cool-beans-hasslekvist-helsingborg</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/cool-beans-hasslekvist-helsingborg</guid><category><![CDATA[Garden]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2019 08:12:16 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Gabriella Dahlman, Lisa Ising</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dark and Monky]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p><span class="caps">MONKS</span> is the South African gin with intense botanicals, nine of them hand-picked and many

  <p>For 8 people</p>

  <p><strong>Pastry</strong></p>

  <p>180 g plain purpose flour +&nbsp;a little extra for dusting<br />
  1 tbsp granulated sugar<br />
  1/4 tsp salt<br />
  150g very cold unsalted butter, cut into thin pieces<br />
  3 to 5 tbsp ice water</p>

  <p><strong>Filling and&nbsp;topping</strong></p>

  <p>250 g rhubarb<br />
  100 g golden caster sugar<br />
  Juice of one&nbsp;orange<br />
  1 tsp corn starch<br />
  &frac12; tsp vanilla paste (or seeds of &frac12; vanilla pod)<br />
  1 small egg, lightly beaten<br />
  2 tbsp chopped pistachios<br />
  1 tbsp golden caster sugar<br />
  Icing sugar, for dusting<br />
  Vanilla ice cream, to serve</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p><strong>Pastry</strong></p>

  <p>Mix flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add butter and toss to coat with the flour mixture. Rub the butter into
  the flour mixture with your fingertips until you get coarse crumbs. Once most of the butter is incorporated, dump the
  flour mixture onto a work surface.</p>

  <p>Drizzle over the ice water (start with 3 tablespoons)&nbsp;and gently knead with the heel of your hand until the
  pastry starts to come together. Add more ice water if needed. Keep kneading until the pastry has just come together. You
  don&rsquo;t want to over-knead it as it will lose its flaky texture.</p>

  <p>Shape the pastry into a flat, 2 to 3 cm thick disc, wrap in cling film and refrigerate to rest for about
  an&nbsp;hour.</p>

  <p><strong>Baked rhubarb</strong></p>

  <p>Preheat the oven to 180 &deg;C / 160 &deg;C fan / gas mark 4. Cut the rhubarb into pieces of different lengths
  (between 22-10cm). Place the rhubarb stalks in a baking tray together with the sugar, orange juice, corn starch and
  vanilla, and toss until evenly coated with the sugar mixture. Bake for 10 minutes until the rhubarb just starts to
  soften and release some of its juices. Take out of the oven and let cool down. Leave the oven on.</p>

  <p>Take the pastry out of the fridge and let it soften for 5 minutes. Lightly dust a sheet of baking paper with flour
  and roll the pastry disk into a 27 cm diameter circle. Don&rsquo;t worry if the edges aren&rsquo;t neat &ndash; this
  galette calls for a rustic feel. Transfer to an oven tray.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Arrange the pre-baked rhubarb stalks next to each other on the pastry circle, leaving a 5 cm border. Using your
  fingertips, carefully fold the edges up and over the rhubarb and brush with egg wash. Sprinkle over the chopped
  pistachios and golden caster sugar. Transfer to the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes until the pastry
  has turned golden and the rhubarb has softened.</p>

  <p>Let the galette cool down slightly before dusting with icing sugar and serving with a scoop&nbsp;of vanilla ice
  cream.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/baking/rustic-rhubarb-pistachio-galette</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/baking/rustic-rhubarb-pistachio-galette</guid><category><![CDATA[Baking]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2019 08:03:26 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Vinny Whiteman , Heidi Lanscuetzer</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[How I Fell Back in Love With Fizz]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>A light-hearted foray into the world of champagne, crémant, sparkling wine and prosecco.</p>

  <p>My memory of every gathering in the lead up to the Millennium New Year was that it involved Fizz of one type of
  another. Prosecco at impromptu gatherings, champagne at dinner parties, cr&eacute;mant with friends who had champagne
  tastes but prosecco budgets, Bucks Fizz when it was too early in the day to justify wine. By January 1st, 2001 I had
  drunk enough sparkling alcohol to last a lifetime. Maybe two.</p>

  <p>However, we recently moved house, and &ldquo;fizz&rdquo;&nbsp;in one form or another has been the housewarming gift
  of choice, so it was time to get over my Millenium issues and find a sparkling drink that I loved. It turns out that the
  quality is better than it&rsquo;s ever been, but bewildering to an enthusiastic but uneducated drinker. I&rsquo;m a
  thorough kinda girl when it comes to food and drink, so in the interests of thorough research I acquired five
  differently produced and priced bottles of bubbly from my local wine merchants Vinotopia, and as it&rsquo;s the type of
  drink that screams for a party, I invited a crowd of friends along to help me taste.</p>

  <p>First up was a classic champagne.&nbsp;I had asked for something quaffable but reasonably priced and was recommended
  Decelle, a non-vintage French champagne. At first glance, this isn&rsquo;t something I would have picked off the shelf
  with it&rsquo;s understated white and orange label not particularly catching my eye, but at this price I was happy to
  give it a whirl on their recommendation.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>It&acute;s time to get over my Millenium issues and find a sparkling drink that I love</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The first taste was of citrus rather than that classic biscuity champagne taste, but it was a good social drink, and
  the apricot flavors were enhanced by pairing it up with a delicious smoked salmon and sliced potato hors d&rsquo;oeuvre
  brought over by a neighbor. Got to love a bit of free trading over the fence.</p>

  <p>Next up was a cr&eacute;mant de Limoux by Berry Bros &amp; Rudd. Cr&eacute;mant is produced in the same way as
  champagne (in that the bubbles are produced by a second fermentation that takes place when the wine is in the bottle)
  but misses out on the champagne title by an accident of birth. This particular bottle is made by the Antech estate in
  Limoux, a family winery for six&nbsp;generations, and very female-led.&nbsp;The forerunner of the wine dynasty was
  Eug&eacute;nie Limouzy, one of the first women in Languedoc to manage a vineyard and it is now run by her
  great-granddaughter Francoise Antech-Gazeau. This had a fairly sharp lemony taste, with lovely delicate bubbles, and a
  creamy aftertaste, and for a tenner a bottle it was an absolute winner for a sunny afternoon in the garden.</p>

  <p>The third recommended bottle was a South African sparkling white, Babylonstoren Sprankle. This is priced at the
  &pound;30 plus price point,&nbsp;which puts it up there with a big name champagne like Veuve Clicquot, so&nbsp;for a
  sparkling wine felt ambitious. The label has a large blue butterfly, inspired by the butterflies that live amongst the
  three hundred&nbsp;varieties of plants in the estates garden that supplies&nbsp;the farm&rsquo;s two restaurants. The
  Dutch owner pushes his eco-credentials even further by choosing not to have foil over the wire and cork, pairing the
  material waste down to the bare essentials. This was expensive for sparkling wine, but it tasted complex and vintage,
  and fully deserved its price point. I was smitten by the taste of almonds and passion fruit, it was beautifully dry with
  a real earthiness to it. It was declared &ldquo;the most interesting sparkling wine I&rsquo;ve had in
  ages&rdquo;&nbsp;by the assembled throng, and was the bottle that everyone went back to for more.</p>

  <p>Bottle number four&nbsp;was another one with great eco-credentials, Wild Thing Organic Prosecco.&nbsp; Wild Thing
  wines are a growing brand developed by Vintage Roots in association with the Born Free Foundation, with a donation for
  every bottle sold benefiting conservation and animal welfare projects around the world. It&rsquo;s also vegan and comes
  in a re-sealable and re-usable swing top bottle, so it has shiny green credentials all round. As with a lot of prosecco,
  this has a fair amount of sugar added to it, and although there were some nice pear notes to it, it&rsquo;s perhaps one
  for someone with a sweeter palate than mine. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

  <p>The final bottle was Saint Andre de Figuiere Atmosph&eacute;re, a sparkling ros&eacute;&nbsp;and another organic
  vegan wine, this one made by two sisters in their coastal vineyard just outside St Tropez. The farm has been fully
  organic for over forty&nbsp;years, instead of using pesticides they bring goats in at the start of autumn to eat the
  fallen grapes and fertilize the soil. This is a gorgeous elegant drink with fine bubbles and the taste of strawberries,
  creamy on your palate but not too sweet, and the perfect way to end the tasting.</p>

  <p>I think my taste for bubbles has definitely been revived. We played around with different glasses to taste from, from
  <em>coupes</em> (better for aroma but the bubbles disappeared) to tall thin flutes (very little aroma but longer lasting
  bubbles). We debated if the flip top bottle would work (it didn&rsquo;t, the next day it was flat) and whether a
  butterfly on a label would deter &ldquo;serious&rdquo;&nbsp;fizz drinkers from buying it (50/50 split). Butterfly or
  not, the Babylonstoren was the surprise hit of the night, and the one everyone would buy again, with Atmosph&eacute;re a
  close second.</p>

  <p>It may have taken nearly twenty years to get over the Millennium overindulgences, but I think Fizz may well be back
  on my shopping list.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;Green box&rdquo;&nbsp;project rises as a renovation of a small disused garage, accessory to a weekend
  house situated on the slopes of the Raethian Alps. A pristine structure constructed with lightweight metal galvanized
  profiles and steel wires wraps the existent volume, transforming it into tridimensional support for the climbing
  vegetation.</p>

  <p>This greenery is mainly composed&nbsp;by deciduous vegetation:&nbsp;Lonicera periclymenum and&nbsp;Polygonum
  baldshuanicum&nbsp;for the main texture, on which climbs up the secondary texture of&nbsp;Humulus lupulus&nbsp;and
  Clematis tangutica.&nbsp;On the basement there are groups of perennial herbaceous plants&nbsp;(Centranthus ruber, Gaura
  Lindheimeri, Geranium sanguineum, Rudbekia triloba) alternated with annual ones&nbsp;(Cosmos bipinnatus, Tagetes
  tenuifolia, Tropaeolum majus, Zinnia tenuifolia).</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Bulbous </em><em>are</em><em> used to ensure a light but continuous flowering</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On the inside, the pavilion has been organized with a room for the gardening tools, a great passion of the owner, and
  an area for cooking and conviviality.&nbsp;Materials have been left rough and simple:&nbsp;galvanized steel for the
  kitchen, larch planks for the floor and the big sliding doors, windows in unpainted galvanized steel, and plain pipes
  for the water supply.</p>

  <p>A small green shelter in the vegetation, privileged observation point on the changing of the seasons in the
  surrounding park. A&nbsp;park that has been left wild in some areas while in others transformed into a flowers&#39;
  garden or in a simple green space, punctuated by beautiful nude rocks scattered through the property.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/architecture-garden/green-box</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/architecture-garden/green-box</guid><category><![CDATA[Architecture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Garden]]></category><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2019 09:35:59 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Marcello Mariana</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Green Monk Fizz]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p><span class="caps">MONKS</span> Mary Jane is the first ever hemp-infused gin in South Africa, with a touch of

  <p>1 cauliflower head (around&nbsp;600 g)<br />
  2 eggs<br />
  1 &frac12;&nbsp;cup finely grated parmesan cheese<br />

  2 tablespoons of tomato paste<br />
  500 g of crushed tomatoes<br />
  1 teaspoon of dried oregano<br />
  1 teaspoon of liquid honey<br />
  salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  1 pinch of chili flakes<br />

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>The dough is made of cauliflower but if you don&rsquo;t know that, it&rsquo;s hard to determine as the taste of

  <p><strong>Start with the tomato sauce: </strong>peel and finely chop onions and garlic. Heat the oil in a large pan and

  <p>Pour in the tomatoes, oregano and honey.&nbsp;Let it simmer without a lid until it thickens, for about 10
  minutes.&nbsp;Stir occasionally.&nbsp;Season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p>Divide the cauliflower head and cut away the root; remove any leaves.&nbsp;Break it into bouquets and run in a food
  processor to a nice &quot;crumble&quot;.&nbsp;Steam or cook in the microwave-oven on a plate for 3 minutes.</p>

  <p>Put the&nbsp;crumbs&nbsp;in a towel and squeeze out as much water as possible.</p>

  <p>Mix with egg, parmesan and salt to a batter.&nbsp;Spread it with the shape of&nbsp;a circle of about
  25&nbsp;centimeters in diameter on a baking tray.&nbsp;Pre-bake it for about 20 minutes until it gets some
  color.&nbsp;Take it out and let it cool a little.</p>

  <p>Spread a couple of tablespoons of tomato sauce over it and tear over the&nbsp;labneh cheese.&nbsp;Crack an egg in the
  middle and bake for another 12-15 minutes.</p>

  <p>Sprinkle with some chili flakes and drip over some good olive oil.&nbsp;Top with arugula and serve.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/pizza-labneh-cheese-eggs-and-arugula</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cooking/pizza-labneh-cheese-eggs-and-arugula</guid><category><![CDATA[Cooking]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2019 14:03:01 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Liselotte Forslin, Ulrika Ekblom</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Dark Glow]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Originally from Kenya and based between Cape Town and London for work, Olivia Sang is the perfect fit for our

  <p>For 8-10 people</p>

  <p><strong>Lemon sponge</strong> (recipe adopted from Gourmet Traveller)</p>

  <p>250 g butter, softened<br />
  400 g caster sugar<br />
  Zest of 3 unwaxed lemons (finely grated) and the juice of 1&frac12;<br />
  1 tsp vanilla bean paste<br />
  5 large free-range eggs, lightly whisked<br />
  400 g plain flour, sieved<br />
  5 tsp baking powder<br />
  150 ml milk, room temperature<br />
  150 g sour cream, room temperature</p>

  <p><strong>Lemon cream cheese frosting</strong></p>

  <p>300 ml double cream<br />
  200 g caster sugar<br />
  360 g Philadelphia cream cheese, full-fat<br />
  5 tbsp lemon curd</p>

  <p><strong>Rhubarb topping</strong></p>

  <p>250 g forced rhubarb, washed, trimmed and cut into 3 to 4 cm pieces<br />
  65 g golden caster sugar<br />
  Juice and zest of 1 unwaxed orange<br />
  &frac12; tsp vanilla bean paste (or seeds of &frac12; vanilla pod)<br />
  1 tsp corn starch<br />
  A handful of raspberries (optional)</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p><strong>Lemon sponge</strong></p>

  <p>Preheat the oven to 180 &deg;C / 160 &deg;C fan / gas mark 4. Line a rounded 22 cm-diameter cake tin with baking
  paper, both bottom and sides (use some soft butter to stick the baking paper).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Use&nbsp;an electric mixer to&nbsp;beat the butter, sugar, lemon zest and vanilla bean paste until it&#39;s pale and
  fluffy.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Reduce the speed of the mixer&nbsp;and slowly add the eggs. Beat for another minute until well incorporated. Beat in
  half the flour and half the baking powder.</p>

  <p>In a separate bowl, whisk milk, lemon juice and sour cream until smooth, then gently beat into the batter. Manually
  fold in the remaining flour and baking powder to just combine.</p>

  <p>Pour the batter into the cake tin and smooth top with a palette knife. Bake in the middle of the oven until golden
  (60 to 70 minutes). Take the cake out of the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack before removing from the
  tin.</p>

  <p>If needed, trim the top flat with a long, serrated knife and, using the same knife or a cake leveler, cut the cake
  into 4 even layers of about 1.5 - 2cm thickness.</p>

  <p><strong>Lemon cream cheese frosting</strong></p>

  <p>Whisk the double cream together with the sugar until it forms stiff peaks. Be careful not to over-whisk it though
  &ndash; it happens quickly!</p>

  <p>In a separate bowl, briefly whisk the cream cheese and lemon curd until well combined. Fold the whipped cream under
  the cream cheese mixture and chill for about 30 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Rhubarb topping</strong></p>

  <p>Preheat the oven (same as for the lemon sponge) and place the rhubarb pieces onto a baking tray. Add sugar, orange
  juice and&nbsp;zest, vanilla and corn starch.</p>

  <p>Mix it all with your hands until rhubarb is coated evenly with the sugar and corn starch. Arrange rhubarb pieces in a
  single layer and bake for 12 to 15 minutes until it&#39;s soft but still holding shape. Try not to stir the rhubarb as
  it falls apart very easily.</p>

  <p><strong>Assembling&nbsp;the cake</strong></p>

  <p>Place one cake layer on a cake board or serving plate and spread one cup of the cream cheese frosting on top with a
  cake palette. Top with another layer and cover with the same amount of frosting.</p>

  <p>Repeat with the remaining two layers and spread the remaining frosting on top and all around the sides, letting some
  of the cake layers shine through to create a naked&nbsp;look.</p>

  <p>Refrigerate the cake for 2 to 3 hours before topping with the baked rhubarb and raspberries.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/baking/lemon-cake-cheese-frosting-roasted-rhubarb</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/baking/lemon-cake-cheese-frosting-roasted-rhubarb</guid><category><![CDATA[Baking]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Vinny Whiteman , Heidi Lanscuetzer</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lamborghini Huracán Performante Spyder]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Now, Lamborghini offers this raging bull in a roofless version. I took a trip to Monaco to experience this car to the
  fullest.</p>

  <p>The battle for the highly sought-after lap record at the&nbsp;N&uuml;rburgring&nbsp;is a constant struggle between
  car manufacturers.&nbsp;For a period, it was Lamborghini and their model Hurac&aacute;n Performante who had the record
  for serial-produced standard cars of 6 minutes and 52 seconds.&nbsp;Unfortunately, they were beaten by the sibling
  company Porsche and its model GT2 RS.</p>

  <p>However, what Porsche has not released, which Lamborghini has, is a roofless version of the same model with which
  they set the record.&nbsp;The combination of the superb sounding V10 engine, performance and road management along with
  it being a convertible is unbeatable.&nbsp;The matte deep blue base color (Blu&nbsp;Aegeus) on the press car I borrowed
  from Lamborghini in Italy did not make matters worse.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The Performante version was launched in 2017 as a&nbsp;fit-for-track&nbsp;version of
  the&nbsp;Hurac&aacute;n</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The story of Lamborghini is long and, as most know, it allegedly began with the
  founder,&nbsp;Ferruccio&nbsp;Lamborghini, being dissatisfied with a Ferrari he had bought.&nbsp;Though before that he
  had created a fortune by starting to manufacture oil radiators, air conditioning units and tractors (1949) which were in
  high demand during Italy&rsquo;s economic boom following the Second World War.&nbsp;Enzo Ferrari dismissed the
  criticism, so&nbsp;Ferruccio&nbsp;took the matter into his own hands, constructing his own&nbsp;Gran Turismo
  machine&nbsp;that&nbsp;met&nbsp;his demands for quality and detail work.</p>

  <p>The first model, released in 1963, was the little-known 350GT which had a 3.5-liter V12 engine designed
  by&nbsp;Giotto&nbsp;Bizzarrini, but the real success came in 1966 when they launched the legendary&nbsp;Miura&nbsp;which
  had a transverse V12&nbsp;mid-engine of&nbsp;3,929 cc and 350/385 hp.&nbsp;765 of them were built.&nbsp;Since then,
  Lamborghini has had a rollercoaster history with a number of owners including Chrysler and Audi (read: VW).&nbsp;But
  also iconic models like the&nbsp;Espada,&nbsp;Urraco,&nbsp;Countach,&nbsp;Diablo, LM002 and&nbsp;Murciellago.</p>

  <p>The model&nbsp;Hurac&aacute;n&nbsp;came about after the hit model Gallardo helped make Lamborghini the company they
  are today.&nbsp;Audi, after taking ownership in &rsquo;98, have been integral to that process. As the first model after
  the takeover, Gallardo was produced in just over 14,000 copies.&nbsp;The performance version was launched at
  Geneva&#39;s car convention in 2017 and then as a&nbsp;track-ready&nbsp;version of
  the&nbsp;Hurac&aacute;n.&nbsp;More&nbsp;downforce&nbsp;thanks to the large carbon fiber wing, better air intake a new
  exhaust system and lower weight are the things that make the Performante faster than the standard version.</p>

  <p>But there is also a system that Lamborghini themselves named ALA (Aerodinamica Lamborghini&nbsp;Attiva)&nbsp;that
  makes a difference.&nbsp;The system means that the wing and spoiler in the front are active and controlled via a
  computer for optimum&nbsp;areodynamics&nbsp;and which makes the&nbsp;downforce&nbsp;more efficient.&nbsp;However, these
  figures change&nbsp;slightly&nbsp;with the roofless version.&nbsp;The 40 kilos lost from the
  usual&nbsp;Hurac&aacute;n&nbsp;has increased by 125 kilos due to the convertible top.&nbsp;Compared to the
  usual&nbsp;Spyder&nbsp;version of the Hurac&aacute;n, however, 35 kilos have been shaved off.&nbsp;This in turn allows
  the car to get from zero to one hundred in 3.1 seconds, which is two tenths slower than the coupe version&nbsp;of the
  Performant.</p>

  <p>But these are numbers you have to live with if you want to enjoy the sun without a roof in your way.&nbsp;To do so,
  only 15 seconds are required to lower the ceiling and it can be done at speeds up to 50 kilometers per hour.&nbsp;The
  top speed of 325 km / h, however, has not changed from the roofed version.</p>

  <p>The pleasure of sitting in the&nbsp;Hurac&aacute;n&nbsp;Performante&nbsp;Spyder, folding down the ceiling and
  pressing the start button under the red&nbsp;flap&nbsp;in the center console and hearing the V10 engine roaring to life,
  is total.&nbsp;Few engines, if any, convey such deep and brutal enjoyment as this one, which without either turbo or a
  compressor generates 640 horsepower.&nbsp;People at the roadside can&#39;t help but look as you blow past with the
  Sport/Corsa-mode engaged and the engine spitting and crackling during the downshifts.</p>

  <p>Lamborghini has mostly produced four-wheel drive cars of their models.&nbsp;This in turn means that you have
  incredibly good control of the car in virtually all modes.&nbsp;You do not have to worry that the car should oversteer
  as soon as you press a little too much on the gas, even when the anti-skid system is engaged in the sport
  mode.&nbsp;Certainly, the car still whips its tail back and forth a bit, but the drive on the front wheels keeps the car
  on the road.&nbsp;At higher speeds, it is clearly noticeable how stable the car is.</p>

  <p>The gearbox is a seven-step double clutch box and the gears can be operated either completely automatically or via
  the large paddles in carbon fiber behind the steering wheel. With each downshift&nbsp;the car automatically rev-matches,
  as the unburnt fuel ignites and lets off that characteristic crackle.</p>

  <p>Pedal to the metal again, and the sound space is filled with a wonderful roar from the engine when approaching the
  red zone at 8,500 revs.&nbsp;The only thing I can feel is total euphoria!&nbsp;How long we can have the pleasure of
  experiencing this I leave unsaid given the prevailing political circumstances surrounding the internal combustion
  engine, but if there is a car to own before this era is over then it is the
  Lamborghini&nbsp;Hurac&aacute;n&nbsp;Performant&nbsp;Spyder!</p>

  <p>1 unwaxed lime<br />
  5 pieces of baked rhubarb, chilled<br />
  10 mint leaves + more for garnish<br />
  4 tsp muscovado sugar<br />
  50ml white rum (e.g. Havana Club A&ntilde;ejo 3 A&ntilde;os)<br />
  Soda water<br />
  Crushed ice</p>

  <p><strong>Baked rhubarb</strong></p>

  <p>250 g forced rhubarb, washed, trimmed and cut into 3 to 4 cm pieces<br />
  65 g golden caster sugar<br />
  Juice and zest of one&nbsp;unwaxed orange<br />
  1 vanilla pod&nbsp;(alternatively 1 tsp vanilla paste)<br />
  1 tsp corn starch</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>Prepare the baked rhubarb first:</p>

  <p>Preheat the oven (180 &deg;C / 160 &deg;C fan / gas mark 4).</p>

  <p>Place the rhubarb pieces into a baking tray.</p>

  <p>Cut the vanilla pod in half lengthways and seeds scraped out with a knife, and add it together with the sugar, the
  orange juice and&nbsp;its zest, and the corn starch. Mix all that with your hands until the rhubarb is coated evenly
  with the sugar and the corn starch.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Arrange rhubarb pieces in a single layer and bake for 12 to 15 minutes until it gets soft but still holds its shape.
  Try not to stir the rhubarb as it falls apart very easily.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Let it cool down slightly before transferring into an airtight container;&nbsp;you can keep it&nbsp;in the fridge up
  to one&nbsp;week.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Cut the lime into 4 wedges, and then halved. Put the lime chunks, mint leaves and sugar into a tumbler, and using a
  muddler, mush everything together until the lime and mint release their juices and aromas.</p>

  <p>Add the rhubarb chunks and gently muddle with the lime, mint and sugar.</p>

  <p>Fill the glass almost to the top with crushed ice.</p>

  <p>Pour the rum over the ice and top off with soda.</p>

  <p>Give it a good stir with a bar spoon and garnish with the remaining mint leaves.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/drinks/rhubarb-mojito</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/drinks/rhubarb-mojito</guid><category><![CDATA[Drinks]]></category><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 12:50:21 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Vinny Whiteman , Heidi Lanscuetzer</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inside / Outside]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Among a sober studio in contrast with the powerful lights from the streets, garments and skin emerge and mix up.</p>

  <p>500 grams of&nbsp;flour<br />
  2 egg yolks<br />
  30 grams of alcohol<br />

  the 100-mark before you can pronounce its full name. This is a sports car with space for the whole family.</p>

  <p>The GT family started with a coupe intended for two people but has now grown with another model.&nbsp;The latest
  addition is a four-door coupe version with room for four or five depending on back seat configuration.&nbsp;Keeping
  track of what distinguishes all versions in the GT family is not simple; this is something I have already addressed with
  the test run of the AMG GT R. The AMG GT 4-Door Coup&eacute; does not have as many variants as the two-door version, but
  almost.</p>

  <p>If we disregard the suffix 4Matic + 4-Door Coup&eacute;, as all versions are called, we can&nbsp;start&nbsp;from the
  bottom of the horsepower ladder and work our way up.&nbsp;The entry-level, least powerful model is called the AMG GT 43.
  It has a 367 HP, straight six-cylinder three-liter engine plus turbocharger.&nbsp;After that, we have the AMG GT 53
  which also has a straight six-cylinder turbo engine with 435 HP.&nbsp;The step after that will be the AMG GT 63, and
  here we find a turbo-powered V8 of 585 horsepower.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>This car is angry!</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>At the top of the ladder, and the car we drove, is the AMG GT 63s.&nbsp;Here, the force of the engine has been
  unleashed, resulting in a breathtaking 639 horsepower and 900-newton meters of torque.&nbsp;If reaching a hundred is
  faster than pronouncing its entire name I leave unsaid; the former however only takes 3.2 seconds. With a top speed of
  315 km / h there is no doubt that this is an insanely fast car.</p>

  <p>At first glance, the car feels almost a little vulgar with the large, wide and forward-sloping grill that instills
  great respect.&nbsp;This car is angry!&nbsp;Had the car been black I would hardly have dared to get in.&nbsp;In our
  case, it is in a matte-blue tone which, despite the grey weather, is eye-catching beautiful.</p>

  <p>The shape of the car with its sloping coup&eacute; line causes it to lie flat on the road.&nbsp;Not as much as the
  main competitor Porsche&nbsp;Panamera, its nemesis. The rivalry has given rise to the nickname &ldquo;Panamera
  killer&rdquo;.&nbsp;It is quite clear what customer group Mercedes is gunning for with the AMG GT63s; they want
  Porsche&#39;s faithful customers who want to fit more people in the car than just two and be able to travel crazy fast
  and at the same time, comfortably.</p>

  <p>When you open the&nbsp;frameless&nbsp;doors and step in you are met by a lovely mixture of leather, carbon fiber and
  brushed aluminum.&nbsp;Sporty and sober in perfect combination.&nbsp;Nowadays there are no analog&nbsp;dials, rather,
  everything is displayed on a widescreen that extends from the driver&#39;s side to the middle.&nbsp;At first glance it
  seems to be in one continuous screen, but it is split in half. The half in front of the wheel displays all the info the
  driver needs, and the other has all the infotainment, but also motor data that can be displayed in an AMG model.</p>

  <p>Screens, in fact, are abundant. The buttons for the car&#39;s settings that are located in the center console are now
  small screens that show the respective settings selected.&nbsp;It all provides a clean and easy-to-read panel that shuts
  off completely when the car is not running.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The sound coming from the four exhausts is notch up from all the music in the world</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>No expense has been spared, and the Burmester sound system&nbsp;is something Mercedes has really been generous
  with.&nbsp;Few match its quality. But that&#39;s not the only thing that is well-sounding in the AMG GT63s. The sound
  coming from the four exhaust pipes behind is a notch better than the best music in the world if you ask me.&nbsp;In
  Sport +&nbsp;mode, the sound cuts, slams and breaks in a fantastic soundtrack.&nbsp;The engineers at AMG are geniuses in
  getting a powerful sound despite turbo-powered engines.</p>

  <p>The art of building a car that works for everything is something the car manufacturers are trying to outdo each other
  in with each new car of this kind.&nbsp;It should be as comfortable as a&nbsp;luxury sofa, as sporty as a Formula-1 car
  and as efficient as an electric car.&nbsp;Of course, such an equation is not easily balanced, but with the AMG GT63s
  Mercedes have outdone themselves.</p>

  <p>In comfort mode, you float forward as if on small fluffy clouds.&nbsp;If you want a little more
  &#39;oomf&#39;&nbsp;then just step up from Sport&nbsp;to Sport + where&nbsp;sport plus&nbsp;gives you a red-hot
  racer.&nbsp;There is also a mode where you can customize the car&rsquo;s behavior, for instance with a sporty gearbox,
  engine mapping and exhaust noise but with comfort on the dampers.</p>

  <p>In addition, there is an environmentally adapted&nbsp;mode&nbsp;that optimizes the car to burn as little fuel as
  possible.&nbsp;The only thing missing would be an off-road mode&nbsp;because even if the car has an intelligent
  four-wheel drive, it is often not enough for off-asphalt escapades.&nbsp;However, the all-wheel drive is a big plus when
  winter road conditions prevail.</p>

  <p>How quick the AMG GT63s is something we&rsquo;ve gone over already, but how just how fast it really is can hardly be
  described with words.&nbsp;The feeling that occurs when you go pedal-to-the-metal and let all 639 horsepowers grab hold
  of the asphalt is exciting.&nbsp;You are pushed back into your seat and the roller&nbsp;coaster&nbsp;effect trigger some
  lovely butterflies in your stomach.&nbsp;If you have a passenger next to you, or, for that matter, in the back seat,
  space will be filled with laughter and screams.&nbsp;One could easily say that the AMG GT63s is a family roller coaster
  to be enjoyed every day.</p>

  <p>For over a decade, serial entrepreneurs and self-confessed adventurers Nic and Di Davis have shared a farm with
  fifth-generation Breede Valley wine farmers Coenie and Edelgard Lategan. Last year the friends turned their attention to
  the business of gin, and they haven&rsquo;t looked back.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Enrobed in the ethereal and infused with a potion of hemp, slangbos and renosterbos, MONKS Mary Jane it&rsquo;s a
  taste of the decidedly divine.&nbsp;If that doesn&rsquo;t strike you as unorthodox, the intriguing selection of
  ingredients in MONKS gins surely will.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Mary Jane is the first ever hemp-infused gin in South Africa</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>MONKS is a dry gin, handcrafted and double-distilled in small batches using a hybrid artisanal still called
  &lsquo;Jennifer&rsquo;, named after Nic&rsquo;s mother and of Nic&rsquo;s own design. Expect intensely flavor-forward
  botanicals, nine of them hand-picked and many endemic to the area. Combine with crystal-clear mountain waters and the
  result is a rewarding one, featuring ripples of citrus, berries and Cape Buchu.</p>

  <p>While MONKS makes no claims whatsoever as to the health benefits of their gins, the key ingredients in each make for
  interesting reading. Mysterium is infused with&nbsp;the herb Sceletium, a natural mood enhancer sometimes referred to as
  &ldquo;the pathway to the gods&rdquo;. Medella features blueberries, farmed by the Lategans and well known as a
  vitamin-rich superfood high in antioxidants; while Mary Jane is endowed with hemp, widely accepted as a miracle
  plant.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Make MONKS the magic ingredient in your next cocktail and experience a taste of something gratifyingly glorious.</p>

  <p><br />
  <em><strong>Green Monk Fizz</strong></em></p>

  <p>50 ml Monks Mary Jane<br />
  25 ml lemon juice<br />
  25 ml simple syrup<br />
  1 handful of basil<br />
  1 Fitch &amp; Leedes soda</p>

  <p>Add all ingredients to your shaker. Fill with ice. Shake for 20-30 seconds. Single strain into a glass of your
  choice. Top up with ice and soda. Garnish with basil or cucumber.</p>

  <p><br />
  <em><strong>Monk-Berry Fizz</strong></em></p>

  <p>50 ml Monks Medella<br />
  25 ml Monks Medella syrup<br />
  1 handful of raspberries<br />
  1&nbsp;Fitch &amp; Leedes soda</p>

  <p>Add your Monks Medella, raspberries and syrup to your glass (a crystal tumbler if you can). Muddle until raspberries
  become a pulp-like consistency and your liquid becomes rich with colour. Top up your glass with ice and soda. It might
  need a stir. Garnish with a couple of fresh raspberries.</p>

  hybrid drive. Enliven went to Spain and got a taste of this new little <span class="caps">SUV</span>.</p>

  <p>The first thing that strikes you when you see the UX 250h is that it feels big and not at all like the smallest SUV
  model in the Lexus family. This is probably because the shapes are robust and taken directly from the larger models, and
  because small Lexus models are a rare sight.&nbsp;It has a large grill with angular shapes that looks like it&rsquo;s
  tightened midway by a corset.&nbsp;Along with the sharp lines of the headlights, it gives everything but a boring
  look.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Do you want a tempered&nbsp;European&nbsp;or an unleashed Asian?</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>If you go closer to the car you see that it is not so big but in fact quite compact and small.&nbsp;The wheel
  housings have some funny shapes which in the upper back are square instead of round.&nbsp;Even the rear has a lot of
  shapes differing from the ones of European brands.&nbsp;This is a language of forms that the Japanese love and which can
  be found in all Lexus models.</p>

  <p>The sharp and angular shapes&nbsp;even continue&nbsp;inside the car, and if you are used to Lexus&rsquo; other models
  you will feel at home in the UX 250h.&nbsp;Above and beside the digital instrument cluster there are two knobs that have
  existed on many previous Lexus models.&nbsp;The right-hand side controls which&nbsp;drive program&nbsp;you want and the
  left if you want to disconnect the anti-skid system.</p>

  <p>As with the design, it takes some time to get used to the controls on the UX.&nbsp;Nothing&rsquo;s out of order, but
  you have to look around a little.&nbsp;The white test car was equipped with the F-Sport package and with a striking red
  and black leather interior.&nbsp;The quality and premium feel are of the highest class and just&nbsp;such a&nbsp;simple
  touch as the sound the door makes when closing is something Lexus technicians invested several hours into
  perfecting.</p>

  <p>In terms of engine, the UX 250h is a so-called self-charging car.&nbsp;That is, the car&#39;s petrol engine, as well
  as the braking regeneration, charges the battery while driving.&nbsp;You neither can nor need to charge the car with a
  cable.&nbsp;Lexus was very early with hybrids, which emerged in 2005 with the model RX 400h.&nbsp;Hybrid drive is a
  treat; the car becomes completely silent when the electric motor kicks in and you can glide forward completely
  silently.</p>

  <p>However, CVT transmission is something you have to get used to.&nbsp;It has no real gear steps but instead works like
  a moped.&nbsp;At high acceleration, the engine revs are, in an annoying way, at max without experiencing the actual gear
  changes. Imagine a moped and how it sounds at full throttle.&nbsp;But as with most things, this is something you get
  used to.&nbsp;As soon as you get up to speed, the revs will flatten out and settle at a lower level where they
  don&rsquo;t sound as strained.&nbsp;Once you begin to understand how and when to accelerate, the journey becomes
  relatively harmonious.</p>

  <p>The fact that the Lexus UX 250h is a small car is particularly noticeable in the back seat.&nbsp;Here, two adults of
  the taller type are not quite comfortable.&nbsp;So loading the car full with the whole family and going on a ski holiday
  may not be what the car is optimized for.&nbsp;However, if intended for yourself and a partner and&nbsp;possibly two
  smaller children, the size of the car should suffice.</p>

  <p>Do not misunderstand me, however, because the car works absolutely fine for long-distance travel and is amazingly
  comfortable.&nbsp;On the whole, the Lexus UX is a very nice car as soon as you get to know it.&nbsp;It has a design that
  stands out and a premium feeling few competitors in this class can match.&nbsp;So in the end, it&rsquo;s a question of
  whether you want a tempered&nbsp;European&nbsp;or an unleashed&nbsp;Asian.</p>

  designers, in the town of Prince Albert.</p>

  <p>Prince Albert, a&nbsp;town well kept and manicured to cater for retired creatives, locals and travel enthusiasts
  alike. Its&nbsp;lifestyle and entertainment ranging&nbsp;from the Karoo olive farms and&nbsp;a working moonshine
  distillery, to boutique hotel-style cottages and a cooking school restaurant, not to mention&nbsp;the majestic Swartberg
  Pass which runs through the Swartberg nature reserve, dotted with caves featuring san rock art.</p>

  <p>WIth these great surroundings, we sat with the enthusiastic Damilola and asked him about his thoughts on the town,
  what his background is and where to next.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Started my journey&nbsp;going for castings. I spent a lot on transportation and almost gave up. I got many turn
  downs but I was determined and focused</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>- Where are you from and what is your cultural background?&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>I am Yoruba born and raised in the city of Lagos State, Nigeria.</p>

  <p><strong>- What do you love about Nigeria?&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>The amazing African culture and its&nbsp;creativity, the Lagos nightlife, the food: <em>amala</em> and
  <em>ewedu</em>, <em>iyan</em> and <em>egusi</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;nice side dishes like&nbsp;<em>boli</em> and
  <em>epa</em>&nbsp;[roasted plantain and groundnut]...</p>

  <p><strong>- How did you get into modeling?&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>A client at my mom store saw me and asked if I played basketball or am into modeling.&nbsp;I told him no. He advised
  me to make use of my height, and that I also shouldn&acute;t forget schooling. So I worked towards it.</p>

  <p>Started my journey into modeling going for castings. I got many turn downs but I was determined and focused. I spent
  a lot on transportation and almost gave up. A big modeling competition, Elite Model Look Nigeria, came along. I entered
  and to God be the glory, I won and represented Nigeria in the world finals in Milan.</p>

  <p><strong>- What do you do aside for modeling?&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>Apart from modeling, I&#39;m also a hairstylist who specializes in female hair!</p>

  <p><strong>- Which country or city would you most like to visit?&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>New York, China, Korea, London, Paris and Milan to build up my career in modeling.</p>

  <p><strong>- You are working with the model&nbsp;agency 20 Model Management in Cape Town. What do you think of South
  Africa&rsquo;s Mother city?&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>Capetown is a beautiful place. I would love to come to visit over and over again asides modeling.</p>

  <p><strong>- What did you think about the town of Prince Albert in the Karoo?&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful and calm place! I would probably love to stay there when I am much older and retired from work
  and hustle of life, but definitely not now because it&rsquo;s too calm and quiet for me to explore. Going there with
  friends for vacation would not be a bad idea though.</p>

  <p><strong>- Where do you see yourself in the future?</strong></p>

  <p>I see myself achieving my dreams of being a world-class model, fashion guru, owning my designer and modeling company
  and also an amazing salon. And because of my love for cooking, I would love to own a big restaurant, and also have my
  own charity home for orphans.</p>

Outwardly unchanged, iconic designer furniture and art photography meet exposed
  stone inside.</p>

  <p>An architect&#39;s dream: the enlightened client. With ideas and a clear aesthetic, but prepared to defer to the
  experts when an idea is unworkable or just plain unsightly. Architects Antonella Tundo and Ugo Dattilo, of the Eutropia
  practice, have found just such a client: the owner of this old farmhouse near Arezzo who, as Tundo explains,
  &ldquo;works in finance, and has homes in Zurich and London, but loves to holiday here near Arezzo with his son
  or&nbsp;friends. He gave us free rein, but it really was a collaborative effort and very rewarding because it captured
  the ethos behind our practice.&rdquo;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>A&nbsp;country retreat for&nbsp;a young city slicker, his child and friends, traditional in flavor, but
  contemporary inside</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>- First we had to remove a series of previous subdivisions. Fixings, floors... We cleared everything away to
  create a new house in the existing shell, redefining spaces and opening the house up, letting light in from other rooms
  since we couldn&#39;t alter the windows. The position, on a slope, offered the option of double and triple split levels.
  All to the benefit of the interior, which is now far brighter and airier. Despite this contemporary vision, however,
  there are timely references to the building&#39;s past, at least one in every room: from exposed stone walls or the
  kitchen table&#39;s reclaimed marble top, to the visible ceiling beams in the dining room or the bathroom sink fashioned
  from the old laundry trough. White walls and the kitchen&#39;s white resin flooring enhance the luminosity. Elsewhere,
  bare, solid-wood floors are preferred.</em></p>

  <p>The owner, a design enthusiast, chose the furniture but took advice on how to arrange it. It includes a number of
  iconic pieces: Eero&#39;s Bubble Chair, Gaetano Pesce&#39;s Up armchair, an Ingo Maurer lamp, and some pieces by Tom
  Dixon. The photos on the walls &mdash;which underline the interior&#39;s contemporary feel&mdash;&nbsp;were an entirely
  personal choice, with more big names such as Quan Knight and Adriana Duque.</p>

His signature is a kitchen based on tasty broths. We
  met Josean to talk about the importance of identity, the Basque sauces and the motorcycle accident where he lost his
  sense of taste and smell.</p>

  <p>Josean Alija is in many ways a controversial cook. No, he isn&rsquo;t a disagreeable guy - it&#39;s his cooking that
  is provocative. He is acclaimed for his personal style, but there are also those who think that Josean&#39;s dishes are
  difficult to understand. Like many Spanish chefs, he bases his cooking on traditional dishes.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The point of departure is Basque food culture and its four basic sauces</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For Josean, the point of departure is Basque food culture and its four basic sauces &ndash; the black with octopus
  ink, the green with olive oil and parsley, the red with red onion and <em>choricero</em> pepper, and the well-known
  <em>pil-pil</em>&nbsp;sauce from cod. It may sound easy, but at the one-star pub Nerua, located in the Guggenheim Museum
  in Bilbao, the dishes are far from simple. Here are served, among other things, fermented coconut with shrimp
  consomm&eacute;, salmon head with sardine broth and grilled oysters with a broth of pears and capers. The dishes are
  small and incredibly flavorful. The broths are complex and elegant.</p>

  <p>&mdash;&nbsp;The broth is important in our cooking. The common denominator when talking about broths, fonds or sauces
  is the taste. All of these are full of flavor. I make most of the broths on vegetables, and the most important thing for
  me is the feeling you get when you eat the dishes with a spoon. The broth is the main character of each dish, and we
  create it with the help of various techniques. Sometimes we boil it over fire, sometimes we make it sous vide, sometimes
  through high pressure. The broths are light and can have an umami or even meaty taste, although 95% are made on
  vegetables and cereals only.</p>

  <p><em>You talk a lot about your emotions. What is so intriguing with broths?</em></p>

  <p>&mdash;&nbsp;The feeling is separated from the taste. What attracts me with a perfect broth is the texture, the
  elegance, the transparency, the purity and the velvety feeling. Density is important, that the taste remains long in the
  mouth; but above all that it is balanced.</p>

  <p><em>There is an underlying thought to each dish please explain more about this.</em></p>

  <p>&mdash;&nbsp;A dish should tell a story. I want the guest to be surprised. A big gift is exciting, but a small one
  makes you thoughtful. I want the dish to be stripped of unnecessary details. In some restaurants you can get an
  incredibly beautiful dish, but when you eat it, it doesn&#39;t tell you anything.</p>

  <p><em>We are in the Instagram-age, where cooks cook for the eye instead of the taste buds. You don&#39;t care about
  appearances and would rather go your own way.</em></p>

  <p>&mdash;&nbsp;The threat to gastronomy is the lack of good taste and knowledge. Many chefs copy styles and dishes
  without understanding what underlies them. Creativity nowadays means copying a popular dish, and it creates a kitchen
  without substance. A chef must reflect and feel. A kitchen without the soul of a chef is an empty kitchen. There are
  many chefs without knowledge. I do not want to criticize anyone, but we must preserve the culture through our
  cooking.</p>

  <p><em>You use odd ingredients from fish, such as the neck and chin. Does it have a cultural background, or is it due to
  sustainability reasons?</em></p>

  <p>&mdash;&nbsp;I see the perfect in the unusual. When I was a child we ate the whole fish, really everything. That is
  how I have learned the different parts of the fish. The neck of the hake is very tasty, rich in collagen.</p>

  <p>Josean Alija is the youngest of five brothers, raised in a family who weren&rsquo;t restauranteurs but where he spent
  a lot of time with his grandmother in the kitchen. As a youngster, Josean was a bit of a rebel in his teens, but when
  his father asked what he wanted to do after elementary school, he replied: &ldquo;I want to be a cook.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><em>The time in grandma&#39;s kitchen had made its mark.</em></p>

  <p>&mdash;&nbsp;I wanted to work with something that makes people happy, says Josean.</p>

  <p>His path took him through restaurant school and jobs in various restaurants, including El Bulli. At age 19 he came to
  the Guggenheim and to Martin Berasategui.</p>

  <p>&mdash;&nbsp;It was 1998 and they had just opened. I got an offer, I was young and had not led a team in the kitchen
  before. I would work with the bistro, bar and fine dining. That&#39;s when I decided to make food that I found
  appealing.</p>

  <p>In 2000, Josean suffered a serious motorcycle accident that almost took his life. He was in a coma for 21 days, and
  when he finally woke up he could neither sense taste nor smell.</p>

  <p>&mdash;&nbsp;I had to start over, discover everything from scratch. It took two years, and I think this has made my
  senses even more sensitive.</p>

  <p><em>You define your cooking with a Basque word, </em><em>m</em><em>uena</em><em>. What does it mean?</em></p>

  <p>&mdash;&nbsp;It&#39;s a way of understanding cooking. It is not possible to translate directly into Spanish, but the
  meaning is about the essence of the soul. That is how I would best describe my cooking.</p>

  city in Scotland that has the most hours of sunshine per year.&nbsp;The relatively abundant&nbsp;amount of
  sunshine&nbsp;combined with wide sandy beaches&nbsp;and a breathtaking hilly landscape, shaped by centuries of hard
  wind, makes the city a timeless tourist destination.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>North&nbsp;Berwick&nbsp;is&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Andrew&#39;s cousin. The cities are reminiscent of each other and are
  just four&nbsp;miles apart</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Both cities are heavily influenced by golf and they both have courses that are older&nbsp;than anyone&nbsp;can
  remember. But while many dream of playing St Andrews and touching history, one rarely hears anyone mention North
  Berwick. It is a pity, because it is just as rich in history and tradition.</p>

  <p>To the east lie the&nbsp;East&nbsp;Links, where golf has been played since the 17th century.&nbsp;In the early 18th
  century, people moved to West Links where the world&#39;s 13th oldest course is today, surrounded by The
  Hills&nbsp;of&nbsp;Fife&nbsp;and Firth of Forth.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are many courses just outside the city that are completely unique - Muirfield, Dunbar, Gullane
  (three courses!), Luffness&nbsp;New,&nbsp;Kilspindie&hellip;</p>

  <p>Many of Edinburgh&#39;s more affluent residents have houses or apartments in North&nbsp;Berwick&nbsp;where they can
  spend the weekends and holidays.&nbsp;Most attractive are the houses on Beach Road,&nbsp;Forth&nbsp;Street, Melbourne
  Road and Marine Parade - they all face the ocean and the views from them are mesmerizing.&nbsp;It&#39;s a city for the
  flaneur.&nbsp;You can walk around for days, not because the city is big but because it is so irresistibly beautiful and
  made for strolling.</p>

  <p>The houses, built in stone, look as if they have been there for many hundreds of years&hellip;&nbsp;which they
  have.&nbsp;It is crowded on the city streets, which are not built for cars but are well suited for the flaneur.&nbsp;In
  the afternoons, you go down at the beach, if the wind and weather allow it, either to walk your dogs or to putt on the
  municipal green&nbsp;with 18 holes on it.&nbsp;When walking in the sand, make sure to watch out for any lousy approach
  shots to number one&rsquo;s green, as you&rsquo;ll be within range. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Not far from North&nbsp;Berwick, the world&#39;s oldest golf club has&nbsp;its&nbsp;origins, originally named The
  Gentlemen Golfers of Edinburgh before being renamed
  The&nbsp;Honorable&nbsp;Company&nbsp;of&nbsp;Edinburgh&nbsp;Golfers.&nbsp;The members initially played
  on&nbsp;Leith&nbsp;Links and later on a course in&nbsp;Musselburgh&nbsp;before moving to Muirfield at the end of the
  19th century.</p>

  <p>20 of the North&nbsp;Berwick&nbsp;Golf Club&#39;s original members were also members of The Royal
  &amp;&nbsp;Ancient&nbsp;Golf Club in&nbsp;St&nbsp;Andrews and The&nbsp;Honorable&nbsp;Company&nbsp;of&nbsp;Edinburgh
  Golfers.&nbsp;In North&nbsp;Berwick&nbsp;they played at West Links - the track that is usually implied when one says
  &ldquo;North&nbsp;Berwick&rdquo;, although there is also an &ldquo;East&nbsp;Links&rdquo;&nbsp;which is Glen Golf
  Club.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The course itself is only&nbsp;150 years old but golf has been played there for far longer</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>That&rsquo;s a known fact, since in 1728 the inhabitants were forbidden to play golf there during the summer months,
  and one was never allowed to play over&nbsp;Castlehill&nbsp;without a&nbsp;forecaddie.</p>

  <p>Many of the people we read about in golf history books have either been born in North&nbsp;Berwick&nbsp;or have made
  indelible imprints in its history sometime during their career.&nbsp;Arnaud&nbsp;Massy&nbsp;came here when he was 21 and
  returned six summers in a row to teach the art of swinging a&nbsp;cleek&nbsp;with an open stance and a&nbsp;baseball
  grip.</p>

  <p>Willie Andersson was born in North&nbsp;Berwick&nbsp;but moved to America and won the US&nbsp;Open&nbsp;in 1901.
  Fred&nbsp;McLeod, who won the US&nbsp;Open&nbsp;in 1908 and played in the match between England and the United States,
  which later developed into the Ryder Cup, was born here; just like Philip Mackenzie Ross was, the man who designed Ailsa
  at Turnberry. Jimmy Thomson and Jack Forrester both emigrated to the US and made their careers over there&hellip;</p>

  <p>And it was actually in North&nbsp;Berwick&nbsp;that Young Tom Morris received the telegram that would be his
  death.&nbsp;He was in town to play a show match with his father and Mungo Park.&nbsp;The telegram told that his pregnant
  wife had fallen seriously ill.</p>

  <p>So the father and son took the fastest way home, by boat across the strait, Firth&nbsp;of&nbsp;Forth, but that still
  wasn&rsquo;t fast enough. It was only four miles to St Andrews, but when the boat docked Young Tom&#39;s wife was
  already dead.&nbsp;Tom never got over this and died on Christmas Day the same year, 24 years old.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The city is a myriad of narrow streets and exciting stories</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Like the one about The&nbsp;Famous&nbsp;Foursome&nbsp;- the match between Robertson / Morris and the Dunn brothers at
  West Links.&nbsp;Those who had come to see the match expected a sensation, and that&rsquo;s just what they
  got.&nbsp;When eight holes remained, the Dunn brothers were four up.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>On the 16th hole the match was all&nbsp;square.&nbsp;But Allan Robertson&#39;s drive on the 17th did not find the
  fairway.&nbsp;Three shots later, and Robertson / Morris found themselves in a bunker short of the green while the
  brothers Dunn&#39;s ball was to the right of the green in two.&nbsp;But - the brothers&#39; ball had ended up against a
  stone.</p>

  <p>The brothers Dunn considered that they were in their full right to move the stone and sent a man to pick up a
  shovel.&nbsp;But Sir David Baird, the referee, ordered that the ball be played as it lay.</p>

  <p>Twice, the brothers swung at the ball without budging it.&nbsp;They lost both their temper and the hole.&nbsp;For
  such a seasoned pair as Robertson / Morris, the last hole was merely a formality. Of course, for us mere mortals, not so
  much.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/golf/north-berwick-saint-andrews-unknown-cousin</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/golf/north-berwick-saint-andrews-unknown-cousin</guid><category><![CDATA[Golf]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 13:00:51 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Tommy Jeppsson</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kia ProCeed — A Date in Barcelona]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>The latest addition to Kia's line is the Proceed. Enliven spent a day in Barcelona to experience this stylish 
  shooting-break model from Korea.</p>

  <p>Kia is steaming forward like a train with new models showing up all the time.&nbsp;Historically, Kia has was seen as
  simply a Korean budget car brand &ndash; that opinion, however, is fast changing.&nbsp;Kia has demonstrated that their
  assortment goes beyond&nbsp;budget models, and nowadays you get a fully equipped car with a heated steering wheel and
  all the features you normally find in expensive German premium cars.</p>

  <p>But it is not only at the Kia equipment level that impresses because they&rsquo;ve also released some fun
  models.&nbsp;Take the Kia Stinger, for example, a rear-wheel-drive coupe sedan with a 370-horse V6 engine.&nbsp;A direct
  competitor to the BMW 4 Series Gran Coup&eacute; but with a price tag far below it.&nbsp;And that helps Kia&rsquo;s
  sales, which are now through the roof &ndash; they are among the best-selling brands in Sweden, matched only by Volvo
  and Volkswagen.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>It&#39;s about daring to let go or to keep driving a more expensive and tamer German</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The new&nbsp;ProCeed&nbsp;is of so-called
  &ldquo;shooting-brake&rdquo;&nbsp;design.&nbsp;Shooting-brake&nbsp;originates from the 19th century English horse-drawn
  carriage (brake) that was used to take out hunting parties on excursions.&nbsp;When cars became more abundant in the
  early 1900s, some of them were provided with these special bodies.&nbsp;The name&nbsp;shooting-brake then&nbsp;fell into
  oblivion, and instead people talked about station or mansion cars, but now the original name is back.&nbsp;Regarding
  the&nbsp;ProCeed, the shape is really nice and the car feels both sober and sporty.&nbsp;A nice detail is the small
  rear-facing shark fin in&nbsp;aluminum&nbsp;which is located in the rear edge of the c-pillar.</p>

  <p>As already mentioned, Kia is generous with the equipment in its models and&nbsp;ProCeed&nbsp;is of course no
  exception.&nbsp;If you choose the GT version you get comfortable chairs in&nbsp;Alcantara&nbsp;and a sporty steering
  wheel that is beveled at the bottom.&nbsp;On the infotainment screen, you can easily air-share your mobile via
  Apple&nbsp;CarPlay&nbsp;or Android Auto.&nbsp;The sound system comes from JBL and will definitely satisfy even the most
  stubborn sound-snob.&nbsp;Thanks to a technology called&nbsp;Clari&nbsp;-Fi, the quality in mp3 format is improved and
  gives a better sound picture.&nbsp;If it truly does make a difference I can&rsquo;t say, but overall it definitely
  sounds good.</p>

  <p>The&nbsp;security systems&nbsp;are also well-developed and the list is long.&nbsp;Among the systems that stand out
  are&nbsp;lane-driving assistance, lane-driving systems, auto brake, rear sensors that detect incoming traffic, automatic
  high beams and fatigue alert.</p>

  <p>The engine of&nbsp;the ProCeed&nbsp;is an efficient 1.6 liter&nbsp;turbocharged, 204 horsepower gas engine.&nbsp;It
  gets the job done and is very pleasant in combination with the 7-step double-clutch gearbox.&nbsp;Granted, it&rsquo;s
  not a sports car we are talking about but with 7.5 seconds to get from&nbsp;0-100&nbsp;and a top speed of 225 km / h
  combined with a mixed consumption of around 0.62 liters per mile, it easily gets a passing grade.</p>

  <p>The amount of equipment you get and the appearance of a&nbsp;ProCeed&nbsp;should attract many customers.&nbsp;With a
  price that starts at just under 300,000, this car is very attractive.&nbsp;One would not get far with that sum buying
  German premium brands. So in the end, it&#39;s all about either letting go and driving a cool Korean or sticking with an
  expensive and tame German.</p>

  original beauty by clever use of millstones and recycled natural materials.</p>

  <p>On one side the Valdarno valley and on the other the Casentino valley, separated by the Protomagno ridge, which is
  also where you&#39;ll find the source of a vigorous stream called Borro del Cigno. In times past, there were several
  water mills situated along the banks of Borro del Cigno, including the Morandi water mill. Two sisters, Lucia and Laura
  Masoni, were struck by the spirituality of the place and bought the mill, spending three years renovating it into a
  holiday home for twelve guests, furnished in an elegant shabby chic style.</p>

  <p>A place to relax surrounded by nature, a place where you can go to reinvigorate your body and mind as you swim in the
  salt-water hydrolysis pool that uses ordinary salt (and does&nbsp;not ruin your hair and skin) instead of chlorine to
  purify the water.&nbsp;A place where you can go for a walk in the woods and a convenient starting point for visiting the
  numerous tourist destinations which abound in Tuscany.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Lucia and Laura were struck by the spirituality of the place</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;This restoration involved some serious structural work,&rdquo;&nbsp;explains the architect Antonella Tundo.
  &ldquo;We demolished several floors, restored staircases, re-terraced the outside areas, but most of all, we had to
  solve the damp problems.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The renovations, including the use of special damp-proof plaster, have prevented water seeping in from the mill, thus
  enabling guests to enjoy only the crystal clear water from the Borro del Cigno stream, which runs underneath the bridge
  leading to the entrance. The two owners and their spouses took care of the decor, restoring old furniture discovered in
  the mill and various reclaimed pieces.</p>

  <p>Lucia&#39;s husband took care of some of the plasterwork and even built the dry stone walls after researching the
  technique. As Lucia Masoni explains: &ldquo;My sister Laura and her husband Alessio had great fun building, repainting
  and covering the walls. They even made the sculpture you see at the entrance to the mill, out of the rings holding the
  barrels together. I like to think that these sculptures reflect our work: doing it together in total harmony.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Some dreams, if you work hard enough, become reality. This is the case of the Ty&nbsp;Coch&nbsp;Inn, which is located
  on the small beach strip, on the left side, right at the foot of the small road that winds its way down from the 16th
  hole.</p>

  <p>The pub is considered one of the 10 best &ldquo;​beach bars&rdquo;&nbsp;in the&nbsp;world, according to the very
  credibly named site &ldquo;Cheap&nbsp;Flights&rdquo;.&nbsp;But in this case, they are right.&nbsp;People flock to the
  pub even though you have to walk 20 minutes to get there. There are no roads to the village
  of&nbsp;Porthdinllaen.&nbsp;None you can drive on if you are a tourist. You have to cross the golf course or walk along
  the beach to grab a pint here.</p>

  <p>And when you do, you can in your imagination travel back in time the 1890s when some men thought that they would use
  that peninsula behind the pub to make something sensible.&nbsp;A golf course, that is.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Here, the sea is visible from every green</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We are in Wales, the northern part.&nbsp;The course is called&nbsp;Nefyn&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;Golf Club, and
  its location is quite unknown. Which is quite strange.&nbsp;And the number of holes is also odd: 24. The original holes
  are&nbsp;1 through 10. Then you can choose to play two different 8-hole loops as the finish.&nbsp;One loop is called
  New, the other Old.&nbsp;How they manage their schedule is beyond me.</p>

  <p>The course is on the&nbsp;Llyn&nbsp;Peninsula, just two and a half hours&nbsp;drive southwest&nbsp;of Liverpool. It
  is a course whose greatest asset is its location.&nbsp;The course itself has been described as both comical&nbsp;and
  bizarre.&nbsp;But we do not complain about that when it comes to, for example,&nbsp;Cruden&nbsp;Bay in Scotland and the
  unsteady cable cars in western Ireland.</p>

  <p>On the contrary.&nbsp;It gives these places their charm.</p>

  <p>But it seems to be the fate of the Welsh golf - to be overlooked, a little forgotten and plagued by misfortune.
  The&nbsp;Open&nbsp;Championship has never been played in Wales. By the way, no Welshman has won that competition, not
  even in its early years. And when Wales and Celtic&nbsp;Manor&nbsp;arranged the 2010 Ryder Cup on the course&nbsp;built
  for the occasion, the&nbsp;Twenty&nbsp;Ten Course, in just a few days, half of all the rain that they get annually fell
  in just a couple days. That was bad timing.</p>

  <p>The rain overshadowed most things, and the stories that always arise in connection with these matches were
  unfortunately all about the rainfall: We all remember that it rained so much that the U.S. team&rsquo;s raingear from
  Sun Mountain&nbsp;started leaking water.&nbsp;This was allegedly due to Captain&nbsp;Corey&nbsp;Pavin&#39;s&nbsp;wife
  embroidering the players&#39; names on their backs.&nbsp;The American players ended up having to buy European
  Pro&nbsp;Quip&nbsp;gear in the souvenir tent.</p>

  <p>The match was finished on Monday &ndash; a first in Ryder Cup history.&nbsp;But after all the rain came the fog, and
  the start was delayed when&nbsp;players&nbsp;were unable to see the flags they were shooting for.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, someone tried to claim that the match was &ldquo;the&nbsp;greatest&nbsp;ever&rdquo;. The applause was
  fleeting, even though the closing ceremony in the glorious sun was better than a BBC thriller. However, from a European
  perspective, it was a happy ending.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Those seeking the genuine have extremely good reasons to schedule&nbsp;some golf days in Wales</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Wales has 200 golf courses on an area two-thirds the size of Sm&aring;land. The first course appeared in the
  1880s.&nbsp;Of course, which club was first is disputed.&nbsp;No one denies that Pontnewydd in&nbsp;Monmouthshire
  was&nbsp;the first actual course.&nbsp;Golf was played there as early as 1875, but the course was a short one and is
  hence not considered a true contender by many.</p>

  <p>Royal&nbsp;Porthcawl, visible on this page, is at least one of Wales&#39; oldest.&nbsp;All early courses
  were&nbsp;links, built on hard-to-use land which was considered useless.&nbsp;Porthcawl&nbsp;grew to be one of the more
  successful courses in Wales.&nbsp;Here, several major competitions have been played.</p>

  <p>The&nbsp;Amateur&nbsp;Championship on six&nbsp;occasions, the Walker Cup in 1995, the Curtis Cup in 1964, the British
  Masters in 1961 and the Welsh Golf Classic in the 1980s.&nbsp;This year, the&nbsp;track hosts&nbsp;the
  Senior&nbsp;Open&nbsp;Championship.</p>

  <p>In 2002, 30,000 golfers came to Wales.&nbsp;In the wake of the Ryder Cup, there were 200,000, of which 76,000 were
  from the USA.&nbsp;Most people who were there found it very fun: that the type of golf played is more like an adventure
  on dramatic topography with sheep, horses and cows that roam freely over playing surfaces that only rarely offer shots
  from a level surface. The shape of the course is just as wavy as the ocean beside it.</p>

  <p>And despite 76,000 Americans have visited, there hasn&rsquo;t been nearly the same green-fee price hike that the rest
  of the UK has experienced.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/golf/wales-welsh-golf-hooks-reels-you</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/golf/wales-welsh-golf-hooks-reels-you</guid><category><![CDATA[Golf]]></category><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2019 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Tommy Jeppsson</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Heidi Palmgren Puts Her Money Where Her Mouth Is]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Green plants, decorative grass and some eye-catching highlights. Heidi Palmgren lives by her own principles of
  gardening: structuring, grouping, minimizing!</p>

  <p>It is the last Sunday of May, and Mother&#39;s Day.&nbsp;At Heidi&#39;s, the Chinese wisteria is in full
  bloom.&nbsp;The pale purple bunches practically burst over the garden wall.&nbsp;She lives next door to the nursery she
  started&nbsp;on a&nbsp;windy field between Lund and Landskrona almost forty years ago.&nbsp;Today,
  L&ouml;ddek&ouml;pinge Nursery is a protected oasis with tall trees, with her sons Jonte and Daniel having taken
  over.&nbsp;They run it their own way - but many of Heidi&#39;s favorites are still in the assortment and her words of
  wisdom are often quoted.&nbsp;She herself designs gardens on a full-time basis and tries to avoid nursery business as
  much as possible.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>What I value most in a garden is the structure.&nbsp;Winter value&nbsp;is most important</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is from the nursery that the photographer sees the Chinese wisteria rise up &mdash;and that leads us
  further&mdash;&nbsp;into Heidi Palmgren&#39;s private sphere.&nbsp;We immediately recognize the blue gates and the
  trimmed greenery from the cover of &ldquo;Space of the Garden&rdquo;, the book that Heidi wrote with Christel Kvant
  around the turn of the millennium.</p>

  <p>Their book is now a modern classic and talks about how to create structure in the garden.&nbsp;Throughout the book,
  they discuss various issues: patina or clean-scrubbed, wall or hedge, linden or chestnut.&nbsp;Especially when it comes
  to the summer flowers things get heated. Summer flowers in the beddings?&nbsp;Out of the question!&nbsp;Such are the
  thoughts of the structured minimalist Heidi Palmgren.</p>

  <p><em>- We learned from each other,</em>she says, summarizing the discussion which became a rather fun, educational
  one.</p>

  <p>And Heidi really lives as she preaches.&nbsp;Her garden is more like a graveled courtyard - but a green and
  structured one with walls, floors and ceilings as basic building blocks.</p>

  <p><em>- It&#39;s only when the garden wanes that the structure reveals itself,</em>&nbsp;she explains, and goes inside
  to get something to drink and her cigarettes, ready to show and tell.&nbsp;Her farm is surrounded by green walls with
  climbing plants such as Ivy, Clematis and Hydrangea.&nbsp;But there are also smart inner walls&nbsp;of a more temporary
  nature.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&#39;t always have to use hedges&rdquo;, Heidi suggests, and shows how she separated the
  courtyard&#39;s dining area through some trimmed boxwoods in baskets and boxes.&nbsp;The dining area also has a roof and
  is shaded by a couple of gracious&nbsp;Southern Books&nbsp;(Nothafagus&nbsp;antarctica).&nbsp;Other small trees that
  screen the light are the Carmencita-rowan tree and an amber tree with fine autumn colors.&nbsp;The floor&nbsp;consists
  of coarse&nbsp;seastone&nbsp;and aggregates of various hues.&nbsp;A good material, Heidi thinks, because it is both easy
  to maintain and to change.&nbsp;Just dig a hole for new plants when you feel like it.</p>

  <p>She has always preferred green plants to flowering ones and her own garden is no exception.&nbsp;Along the gable,
  various kinds of sages grow, both variegated, lime green and dew&nbsp;blue.&nbsp;Ferns, bamboo, and hedges are other
  examples of green.&nbsp;The hens are both highly vivid and curious, of the Orpington variety.</p>

  <p>In the center she has grouped pots and boxes of spice plants and bushels, which the hens happily pick at before they
  are chased away.&nbsp;In addition to the lavish Wisterias, the flowers are so downplayed that they are almost difficult
  to detect, such as Gaura and Kotula.</p>

  <p>And then she tells how she scratches off the red coat on secateur handles.&nbsp;How she puts her cigarettes in a nice
  tin box - because it disturbs her aesthetic sensibilities.&nbsp;She was even more extreme when Jonte, Daniel and their
  brother Robert were small.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Ugly milk packages were not allowed on the dining table and the ketchup bottle was covered in foil</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The sons have been happy to poke at their aesthetic mother over the years.&nbsp;One year they gave her a horrendous
  garden gnome as a Mother&#39;s Day gift.&nbsp;Another time, the boys hung up plastic throughout the garden - just to
  tease.&nbsp;Heidi laughs heartily at the memory and is joined by Jonte who has stopped by during a break from the
  nursery.</p>

  <p>She has made herself known as a rather strict and&nbsp;laborious&nbsp;garden&nbsp;personality, characterized by her
  German upbringing and growing up in the shadow of the Second World War.&nbsp;The old men in the nursery thought she
  seemed manly, lifting heavy bags herself, but Heidi has never been afraid to stand out. She does, however, have another
  side to her that loves the garden&#39;s more subtle essence, the changes of light and the feeling of walking
  barefoot.</p>

  <p>She was one of the first women in the gardening industry to get a spot in TV-shows. Heidi was on shows such as
  &ldquo;Sk&ouml;na&nbsp;S&ouml;ndag&rdquo;, with the presenter Bertil Svensson talking about &ldquo;the lady in
  L&ouml;dde&rdquo;&nbsp;that cultivated grass.</p>

  <p><em>- People wondered what I was going to do with those weeds, it wasn&#39;t that common at the time.&nbsp;I started
  with four square meters of the variety&nbsp;Miscanthus&nbsp;Nishidake&nbsp;and&nbsp;gradually&nbsp;expanded.</em></p>

  <p>Decorative grass is still an important feature of the gardens she designs.&nbsp;At her own place she has them mostly
  in pots.&nbsp;Ideally, there are various&nbsp;Molina&nbsp;varieties such as Heidebraut&nbsp;and Transparent&nbsp;or the
  striped Hakonechloa Aureola, although they belong more to the high summer, barely having had time to sprout in
  May.&nbsp;&ldquo;The grasses are the ballet of the garden beddings,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Heidi, quoting
  Karl&nbsp;Foerster,&nbsp;the German gardener whom she admires.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Ulla Molin wondered if Heidi could create a garden grove for her after her death</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Another gardener who has had a decisive influence on Heidi Palmgren is Ulla Molin, the garden designer and
  influential editor of the autonomous-living magazine &ldquo;Hem i Sverige&rdquo;&nbsp;in the years 1944-66.&nbsp;Despite
  an&nbsp;age difference&nbsp;of over thirty years, they became close friends.</p>

  <p><em>- Ulla was my role model, my friend, my teacher.&nbsp;Ulla looked like a little cotton pad, but she was an iron
  woman who always stuck to her ideals, even when it cost her.&nbsp;She always cheered me up, though we never worked
  together.</em></p>

  <p>Somewhere during all their talking, Ulla Molin wondered if Heidi could create a garden grove for her after her death
  &ndash; and so it was, though it was not the original intention.&nbsp;For the Cultural Capital of the year exhibition in
  Stockholm -98, Heidi was asked to contribute a muse garden for the large exhibition at Rosendal.&nbsp;She chose to pay
  tribute to her friend and called it &ldquo;Hommage &agrave; Ulla Molin&rdquo;&nbsp;with all the plants and details
  that&nbsp;were typical of her: a plum grove with forget-me-nots and as a contrast, a more tempered part with trimmed
  greenery.</p>

  <p><em>- We met when the sketches were finished but she didn&#39;t want to look at them, not wanting to influence
  them.&nbsp;She trusted me and I hoped she would come up to Stockholm and see my tribute but she passed away just a few
  months before it was built.&nbsp;I hope she&#39;s smiling down from heaven at what I did.</em></p>

  <p>Inadvertently, her homage became the memorial Ulla Molin had envisioned - and it still exists, or at least the
  remains of it. After the success at Rosendal, Heidi bought the leftover materials and re-opened the tribute at
  L&ouml;dde Nursery, where it lives on behind a delimiting hedge. Here are the plants preserved: plum trees, various
  ground cover, sage and lamb&#39;s ear, the passage of French pine bark and Signe Persson-Melin&#39;s cement slabs
  &ldquo;IV&Aring;G&rdquo;. Only the little gazebo, designed by Mats Theselius, is missing. The plants are Ulla
  Molin&#39;s, but interpreted in Heidi Palmgren&#39;s way. The relation is very clear. They share the same feeling for
  modest, simple plants, clear structure and the contrast between hard and soft.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Heidi disappears indoors, but comes right back with a small, orange brocade bag.&nbsp;It looks like a
  fancy evening bag, but inside are Ulla Molin&#39;s bonsai tools.&nbsp;Heidi got to inherit them, along with some
  slides&nbsp;and a small Japanese fire pot that still adorns the courtyard.</p>

  <p><em>- I still hear her wise words that have affected me so much, &ldquo;never renounce your ideals&rdquo;.&nbsp;And
  those words I have tried to live by.</em></p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/heidi-palmgren-puts-her-money-where-her-mouth</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/heidi-palmgren-puts-her-money-where-her-mouth</guid><category><![CDATA[Garden]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2019 12:00:27 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Pernilla Bergdahl, Lisa Ising</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Helmtrude's Garden]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Well hidden in a backlot in Lund, we find the garden of Helmtrud Nyström. On second thought, it is very similar to

  <p>Founder Amanda Laird Cherry of the&nbsp;Durban based brand&nbsp;<em>ALC Menswear,</em>&nbsp;in collaboration with
  head designer Brendon Sturrock, created an innovative collection&nbsp;knocking it out of the park! With fabrics such as
  genuine Shweshwe juxtaposed with&nbsp;camo and&nbsp;hand-dyed marble prints, their language offers&nbsp;a deep
  experience of the South African lifestyle with classic Asian influences.&nbsp;<em>Floyd Avenue</em>, a Soweto-based
  designer who&rsquo;s canvas is inspired by music, culture, activism and sincerity of character as seen in his camo
  pieces.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em>Chulaap</em>, a Thai-South African designer who takes inspiration to another exciting level, from layered
  traditional styles, African wax fabric and&nbsp;Shweshwe prints to inspiring knits.&nbsp;<em>Nicholas Coutts</em>, with
  his developing weaves, knits and tapestries&nbsp;is also, as all the designers in this shoot, supporting the local rag
  trade, and hopefully growing the industry back to its former workforce.&nbsp;<em>Mmuso Maxwell</em>, an African design
  duo originally from the town of Bloemfontein, better known for its industrial farming than its creative community, is
  growing&nbsp;after being selected for Vogue Talents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em>Rich Mnisi</em>, another Soweto designer, is taking the local and international scene by storm with his cutting

A sentence that the Norwegian
  artist Elin Glærum Haugland loves, perhaps because it also describes her approach perfectly.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;<strong>Back in 2014&nbsp;you finished your Fine Arts deg</strong><strong>ree in Trondheim, Norway. Your final
  exam included a&nbsp;short film called &ldquo;Searching for Eden&rdquo; and by watching it one could feel your passion
  for nature.</strong></p>

  <p>&mdash;By then, I had already joined some friends on their journey to Galapagos and Peru in 2013, and it inspired my
  solo show &ldquo;Journeys to Galapagos and the South Pacific &ndash; an Exploration Through Painting&rdquo;&nbsp;the
  same year. I had never had any dreams of traveling, but this journey opened my mind in many ways. I realized that in my
  studio I was already traveling to the places before the journey began; I had always loved plants and longed to
  experience thick, green jungle.</p>

  <p>I started to define my dreams, and my bachelor project became a part of this process. I traveled to The Eden Project,
  in England, to gather images of tropical plants for a giant 4-meter wide acrylic jungle painting and for my short film
  &ldquo;Searching for Eden&rdquo;. My dream was to be close to plants and their natural habitat while I was painting.
  That is how my journey started, longing to go to the place in the world with the most diversity of plants: the Amazon
  jungle. After my bachelor degree, I spent the next year planning my first journey to be close to plants and learn how to
  paint using colors from nature.&nbsp;And in November 2015, I left. For an almost five-month-long journey, alone, to the
  Peruvian Amazon and several Pacific islands.</p>

  <p><strong>Your grandfather, Knut Haugland, was part of the crew of the Kon-Tiki expedition that took place in 1947. He
  was also the director of the Kon-Tiki museum in Bygd&oslash;y, Oslo. I guess he awoke your curiosity about these remote
  cultures.</strong></p>

  <p>&mdash; In my teens I was lucky to hear many exciting stories about the South Pacific and its islands during that
  time. Still, the story about six men crossing the Pacific Ocean on a balsa wood raft&nbsp;felt like a fairytale to me.
  Right before my grandfather passed away in 2009, his life story was told by Svein S&aelig;ter in the book
  &ldquo;Operat&oslash;ren&rdquo;. While reading it the stories came to life, especially the parts where he describes the
  incredible starry sky and glowing bioluminescence surrounding the raft at night, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

  <p>To get closer to these stories, I started working part-time at the Kon-Tiki Museum in 2012; there I learned a lot
  about Thor Heyerdahl [the arranger of the Kon-Tiki expedition] and he became one of my leading stars. While working
  there, I got interested in the subculture of Tiki Pop,&nbsp;that emerged in the US in the early 1930s. It was the
  American dream of a Pacific paradise, a place that actually only exists within the subculture. In 2014, the Quai Branly
  Museum in Paris had an exhibition on the history of Tiki Pop, and another one about the history of the tattoo, which
  started in Polynesia; there I saw my first &lsquo;tapa&rsquo; barkcloths. The patterns of both the tattoos and the
  &lsquo;tapa&rsquo; went straight to my heart.</p>

  <p><strong>The environment has a big importance for you, and that is of course reflected in your
  artwork.&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>&mdash;Yes. Ever since I was a little child, I felt like the flowers in the forest were communicating with me. What
  they showed me touched the core of my being. I can&rsquo;t put it into words, but I think that everything I create today
  comes from this meeting with nature. As I was growing up, I felt that many of the things adults tried to teach me about
  reality were wrong. Even cutting down a tree felt wrong. As a fifteen-year-old I read about the world views of people
  like Native Americans and I found stories that made sense to me. And when I traveled to the Amazon jungle at the age of
  27 I finally found people who shared my views and inspired me further. I am especially thinking about the belief that
  everything that surrounds us has consciousness. Rocks, plants, forests, oceans, rivers, drops of water. Brushstrokes.
  Paintings.</p>

  <p>There are two British botanical artists who inspire me very much in their approach to nature. Marianne North (b.
  1830) felt so drawn to the tropical flowers in Kew Gardens that she traveled the world on her own to paint plants in the
  field, until she died from all the diseases she had caught on her travels. Charles Darwin was a supporter of her work,
  as she painted the plants in their natural surroundings and that was very unusual at the time. Margaret Mee (b. 1909)
  specialized in plants from the Brazilian Amazon, and devoted her life to fighting for the protection of the Amazon, as
  mining and deforestation started to increase. I want to create a story of my own, building on their values.</p>

  <p><strong>Eventually, your artistic experiences and interests made you take the decision of going where the prime
  materials were. How did you feel before your very first journey?</strong></p>

  <p>&mdash;To begin with, my dreams felt so big and distant that I almost did not dare to dream them. I was not
  interested in traveling far away and the thought of doing so, and alone, scared me so much. But the thought of painting
  surrounded by tropical plants made me feel alive, and if my journey could be for something bigger &minus;not a vacation,
  but to gather knowledge and then dare to speak about it&minus; then it could be worthy.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>During my year of planning, I pushed myself to do things like sleeping in the forest alone and jumping with a
  parachute from a plane</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Through my colleagues in the Kon-Tiki museum I came in contact with the Explorers Club, and suddenly I was surrounded
  by people who cheered for my ideas. And when the day came, I felt ready.</p>

  <p><strong>This artistic, but also humanist pursuit has allowed you to meet ancient cultures that otherwise you would
  have just known by the stories of your grandfather.&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>&mdash;When you grow up close to nature and inherit a belief system that has been passed down for generations by
  people who lived even more deeply immersed in nature, what does reality then consist of? You start off from a completely
  different basis than the one we think is true in our &lsquo;modern&rsquo; societies. I am interested in the ways that
  humans from different cultures have expressed themselves traditionally, using materials directly from nature. I love to
  use handcrafts as a way to start relations with people I meet, and to learn about different traditions. Through my life
  and work I want to share these perspectives, show that there are alternatives.</p>

  <p><strong>Meeting all these people, being allowed to participate in their traditions and knowledge is a
  one-in-a-million opportunity. One would like to make the most of it. Did you follow any special education or training
  for your journeys?&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>&mdash;In 2015 I took a class in Social Anthropology at the University of Oslo to prepare for my journeys of
  exploration and art production. This was very helpful to get a better understanding of the diverse ways of living on the
  planet, and ways of showing respect when meeting with a different culture.&nbsp;To give an example, I was introduced to
  different family systems that exist. In some cultures it might be the brother of the genetic mother who has the father
  role of the child, and the person we would count as the father instead has the role of an uncle. When I stayed in Samoa
  for a month in 2016, I learned that it is common in some islands to raise some male children as female, who will then
  become caretakers in the family.</p>

  <p>I am by no means an expert on anything. My main focus is on art and creative expression, and I have visited many
  cultural museums to get an overview of variations in symbolism and materials. My mediums of expression are painting,
  collage, text, experimental film and photography, and I transform the impressions I get in each place, both from nature
  and the culture, into an abstract language.</p>

  <p><strong>Tell us more about your first research trips, that took place between 2013 and 2016.&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>&mdash;During the first research trips, I didn&rsquo;t know exactly what I was looking for. I knew that a tipping
  point between art and science triggered something in me. I wanted my process to be closer to scientific research, and my
  interests were on botany, alchemic processes, anthropology, cultural history and traditional art practices. So
  everywhere I went in Europe I visited museums and botanical gardens. From 2013 I gathered inspiration in England,
  France, Czech Republic and Iceland, as well as the USA and the journey to Galapagos, Ecuador and Peru.</p>

  <p>After these journeys, I developed an interest in traditional Pacific art expressions. My fascination with tropical
  plants had increased, and I started getting curious about other ways of viewing and understanding reality. I have always
  loved painting, and I wanted to find a way to go deeper into the essence of what a painting is, combined with a
  closeness to nature. That&rsquo;s where the idea of painting close to nature came. I started to plan my first big
  journey of exploration, focusing on natural color pigments. I first stayed for two months in the artist&rsquo;s
  residence Sachaqa Centro de Arte, in the Peruvian Amazon jungle, situated in an area of misty hills covered in tropical
  forest. Then continued to Easter Island, Tahiti, and Western Samoa where I stayed for a month in Tiapapata Art
  Centre.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The nature in Samoa is the most beautiful I have ever seen</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Their social structures and traditional way of life are very much preserved and I found this part of my journey very
  tough. After all the lessons I learned there, it was a relief to spend my last three weeks driving and hiking around New
  Zealand. What really stands out in my memories from that part of the journey is the time I spent in Te Urewera National
  Park. The Māoris living there (the Tūhoe, which means &lsquo;children of the mist&rsquo;) had just been given back their
  rights to the land. Now they are in full development of running the park themselves and receiving visitors.</p>

  <p><strong>In 2017 you also traveled to South America and conducted two fieldwork trips: to Amazonas, Brasil, where you
  attended an art program in a forest reserve outside Manaus, and to the Peruvian side of the Amazon
  jungle.&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>&mdash;Yes, I went on two separate journeys. The first one started with a one-month stay in Easter Island living with
  a local family. Then I traveled back to Sachaqa Centro de Arte and stayed there for two months. This experience taught
  me more about the balance between masculine and feminine energy (Easter Island has a history of being a male-dominated
  warrior society). Later that year, I visited Brasilian areas of the Amazon. This journey became a more political one. I
  was so lucky to be chosen for the Lab Verde Art Immersion Program; there we were thirteen artists from different
  countries meeting with scientists on the Rio Negro river, in a nature reserve called Adolpho Ducke. This area is closed
  for visitors and used as a science base to run experiments.</p>

  <p>After the program I continued on my own for about a month,&nbsp;up the river to the small town S&atilde;o Gabriel da
  Cachoeira, close to the Venezuelan and Colombian borders. This area is very special, as almost all of the population
  have an indigenous background. The surrounding forest is one of the highest populated areas in the Brasilian Amazon and
  is packed with political issues. I was surprised to discover that missionaries still have a great impact on these
  societies.</p>

  <p>One of the friends I met there was Juliana Lins, a biologist working for the anthropological institution ISA, who
  spent some periods of time at a village by the Tique river, studying the local&rsquo;s belief system and relation to the
  forest. How they talk to the clay before taking some for making pottery. How they believe that under this world in the
  forest, there is another river underground where trees, plants and animals are humans. Scientists have discovered that
  there actually is an underground river beneath the Amazon.</p>

  <p><strong>You recently came back from Easter Island. What has changed in your perspective this time? Have you found
  something that you didn&rsquo;t find on your previous trips there?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&mdash;Yes, so much. After the month I was there in 2017 I had only scratched the surface. I felt that with my
  2018-19 journey the time had come to dive deeper. The terms &lsquo;tapu&rsquo; and &lsquo;mana&rsquo; had caught my
  attention in previous journeys. &lsquo;Tapu&rsquo; is a term used historically for things that are forbidden to do or
  places that one should not visit in the island. &lsquo;Mana&rsquo; is a complicated term and hard to explain in words;
  it is about energy and I have heard people say that the island has now lost the &lsquo;mana&rsquo; it used to have.</p>

  <p><strong>Last year you took part in the PechaKucha Night Oslo, your experimental film &ldquo;And their faces will be
  painted&rdquo; was screened at the Fresh Stream Experimental Film Festival in Los Angeles, and you were also invited to
  the grand annual Explorers Club dinner, in New York City. Are there any upcoming events in which you will be
  participating?&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p>&mdash;I am currently working with the Norwegian musician Kari Harneshaug on cover art for her next two singles; I
  have previously produced an experimental music video for one of her tracks. I am part of Under the Perfect Canopy, a
  traveling group show that will take place in the Art &amp; Mind Center in Nagoya, Japan during March 17<sup>th</sup> -
  31<sup>th</sup>, and in Galeria da Arte e Pesquisa in Vittoria, Brazil, during May 2<sup>nd</sup> - June 7<sup>th</sup>.
  Also, on the 27<sup>th </sup>of April my studio at Prindsen artist collective will participate in&nbsp;Oslo Open.</p>

  <p>The bulbs of Narcissus, Tulips and Crocus are usually planted between bushes or in existing beds.&nbsp;But it works
  just as well to put them on your lawn.</p>

  <p>Choose a place where the lawn is not so dense, so the flowers sprout more easily. However, an older, firmer lawn will
  do surprisingly well.&nbsp;The location should ideally be half-shaded, but direct sunlight also works, although this
  results in a shortened flowering period.</p>

  <p>Mark with a spade where you intend to dig.&nbsp;Make the &ldquo;boxes&rdquo; as wide as the spade blade.&nbsp;Then
  lift off each turf slab and put them in ordered rows (they will be replaced later!).&nbsp;Till the open earth and mix it
  smooth, making it lighter.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Flowers generally bloom faster in bright sunshine</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Now we plant the bulbs.&nbsp;Sometimes you can find ready-made earth mixes specifically for flower beds, or otherwise
  you can mix the earth yourself.&nbsp;The final color scheme of the meadow will be of whites and light
  yellows.&nbsp;Larger bulbs need to be dug down, while smaller ones such as Crocus and Pearl Hyacinths can simply be laid
  on top of the soil.</p>

  <p>Replace the turf slabs and step back and forth over the surface several times to firmly press them into the
  ground.&nbsp;It is important that the grassroots are in contact with the soil.&nbsp;Water if you notice any dryness.
  Then, simply wait for spring.&nbsp;Already in February-March, the first Snowdrops and Crocuses will be on their way up,
  and then the rest will follow suit well into May!</p>

  <p>Tip!&nbsp;When the meadow has fully bloomed, let the grass grow up and the flowers wither undisturbed.&nbsp;A few
  weeks after midsummer most of the leaves will usually have yellowed and will be easy to pull up.&nbsp;Then you can start
  mowing the lawn!</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/diy-flower-bed</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/diy-flower-bed</guid><category><![CDATA[Garden]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 10:40:15 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Eva Robild</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Mediterranean in a Pot]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Get yourself a concentrated piece of the Mediterranean Sea on your terrace by growing your plants in pots. With the
  right mix of flowers, edible plants and green spices, it is easy and wonderful to enjoy the delights of the South even
  up here in the North!</p>

  <p>Since forever, we humans have always liked to surround ourselves with exotic plants, and now they&rsquo;re easier to
  obtain than ever before. The flowers that create the Mediterranean atmosphere are oftentimes ones we already have in our
  gardens - like Geranium, Heliotrope and Hetunia.&nbsp;Choose plants with fragrant leaves or striking colors for the
  right mood.&nbsp;Then add the slightly more exotic, such as Bougainvillea, Gloriosa or Passion Flower.</p>

  <p>Chocolate flower and Scented lily are tuberous plants that start growing in spring, like Dahlias.&nbsp;Both are
  beautiful and have a seductive smell. If you have a bright and frost-free space during winter, treat yourself to a
  Nerium or&nbsp;African&nbsp;Blue Lily; two magnificent plants of typical Mediterranean character, but ones that need to
  pass the winter in cool air.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Terracotta pots, baskets, buckets, cans... mix neat and simple vessels to give&nbsp;the right Mediterranean
  feel</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Agave, Aloe, Houseleek and various other succulents are also part of creating a Mediterranean flair.&nbsp;They are
  easy to care for because they can withstand sun and dryness well.&nbsp;Agave is a sculptural plant that fits
  magnificently in a pot while the others are fine when bunched together like little still lifes.</p>

  <p>Flavors and scents are an important element to bring the whole package together.&nbsp;Revel in spice plants, which
  thrive excellently in pots, and place them near your favorite chair.&nbsp;Rubbing the leaves together on rosemary,
  lavender and sage as well as odd herbs such as pineapple salvia and blackcurrant salvia, releasing their respective
  fragrances&hellip; it never gets old.</p>

  <p>If you have space inside for it, a small olive tree is always fun, as well as a fig or citrus plant in a
  pot.&nbsp;Today they are easy to get hold of and often affordable, but it can still feel like a waste to buy them if you
  do not know in advance where they will be kept during winter.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Reinforce with pots</strong></em></p>

  <p>Terracotta pots&nbsp;have a self-evident use, but around the Mediterranean people are just as likely to use any old
  vessel; that is, baskets, buckets and cans.&nbsp;The mix of neat and simple gives the right Mediterranean
  feel.&nbsp;Find bargains at&nbsp;your local flea market!</p>

  <p><em><strong>The more, the merrier</strong></em></p>

  <p>Bunch your Mediterranean plants on the same terrace or balcony.&nbsp;This makes the effect more
  pronounced.&nbsp;Choose a place with plenty of sun and heat, preferably next to a sun-drenched wall.&nbsp;In the
  semi-shady corners, place your myrtle, pallet blade, ivy and peppermint geranium.</p>

  <p><em><strong>The Mediterranean in your sunroom</strong></em></p>

  <p>Greenhouses and sunrooms are perfect places to indulge in the Mediterranean atmosphere, not least because the heat
  stays behind the glass panes.&nbsp;During the high summer, mainly succulents and geraniums can withstand extreme heat in
  this environment.&nbsp;But, still, make sure to air out space on those especially hot days!&nbsp;Spring and Autumn are
  times when you can bring your other Mediterranean plants into the sunroom.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Advice for care</strong></em></p>

  <p>Most Mediterranean plants are resistant to drought, but you still have to water and fertilize frequently, perhaps
  every day when summer peaks.&nbsp;A small pot dries up quickly!&nbsp;Keep in mind that even sun-lovers may need to be
  protected against the strong spring sun, especially when they have just left behind the winter weather in
  May-June.&nbsp;Please cover them in some non-woven fabric and let them acclimate slowly.&nbsp;Move the plants indoors
  when there&rsquo;s a chance of frost.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Surviving the winter for the potted plants</strong></em></p>

  <p>Group 1: Figs, peaches, olives, mulberries, grapes,&nbsp;African&nbsp;blue lily, laurels, lavender, thyme,
  Blackcurrant salvia, Pineapple salvia.&nbsp;Preferably lots of light and frost-free, ie with full daylight (or
  fluorescent lighting) at a temperature between 2 and 10 degrees Celsius.</p>

  <p>Group 2: Chocolate flower, Murielae, Gloriosa and Dahlia.&nbsp;Remove the pots after the first frost and store the
  tubers loosely or in the pot, in dark, cool, and frost-free surroundings.&nbsp;Take them out again in March-April and
  replant them in new soil.</p>

  <p>Group 3: Myrtle, Passionflower, Bougainvillea, Agave, Citrus, Geranium, Hibiscus, Nerium, and succulents are best
  placed in a bright spot with a temperature of between 10 and 15 degrees, but can also make do at room temperature if
  they are regularly supervised.&nbsp;Keep the soil only slightly moist, do not fertilize it, and fight any vermin as soon
  as they appear.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/mediterranean-pot</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/mediterranean-pot</guid><category><![CDATA[Garden]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 10:00:42 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Eva Robild</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Destination Salina]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>An island dominated by the wind, bewitches with its spontaneous vegetation, pastel colors, genuine flavors… and a
  thousand anecdotes told by bold storytellers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As soon as you arrive in Salina, go and speak to Santino!&rdquo;&nbsp;This is the recommendation of Barbara
  Vergnano, a Milanese gallery owner who has been a regular on the island for over twenty years. We trust her. Santino
  Ruggera is the owner of A Cannata, a family-run hotel restaurant on the Lingua waterfront. He is kind and affable and
  loves to tell us interesting anecdotes, so he immediately becomes our storyteller.</p>

  <p>A real connoisseur of his land, he is an attentive observer of the people who live there or come to visit, remaining
  enchanted. His hospitality strikes us. It is known that the people of the South are open and accessible, but the
  surprise of having their car available for a whole week catches us unprepared.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The inhabitants of Salina have always distinguished themselves among the Aeolian peoples for their
  entrepreneurship</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Disembarking from the ferry, loaded with suitcases and photographic equipment, we immediately asked ourselves how we
  could have moved between those winding and uphill roads and, with discomfort, we had looked at one of the many
  motorbikes to rent near the port. So Santino&#39;s car was an unexpected gift, the first of the many kindnesses our
  friend will afford us, always available to satisfy the most bizarre requests.</p>

  <p>This land, created by volcanic activity, dominated by the wind, enchants us with its spontaneous vegetation, the
  forests of ferns, pines, chestnut trees and caper bushes, one of its most precious resources, along with Malvasia, a
  wine with an intense aroma and with a sweet taste. Thus called by the Romans who collected salt in the small lake of
  Lingua, originally named&nbsp;Didyme by the Greeks, or the island of the twin mountains, which, seen from the sea,
  resemble a woman&#39;s breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The inhabitants of Salina have always distinguished themselves among the Aeolian peoples for their
  entrepreneurship, so much so that they have been able to obtain complete administrative independence since
  1867,&rdquo;&nbsp;Santino said with a hint of pride. &ldquo;And not only that. At the beginning of the 20th century, the
  municipality of Salina was divided into three other small towns that are still completely autonomous today: Santa Maria
  Salina, Malfa and Leni&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>Through these three villages, it is possible to retrace the history of the place: Santa Marina is the main center, to
  which the salt trade and that of agricultural products belonged. Lingua developed around the salt lake overlooking the
  sea. Malfa boasts the most fertile land, where Malvasia crops thrive. On the opposite side of the island, we discover
  Leni, another center of agricultural activity whose name comes from the Greek Len&ograve;i, meaning &#39;tub&#39; for
  crushing grapes. As a confirmation of the island&#39;s seafaring soul, Leni also has its hamlet on the seashore,
  Rinella, with an enchanting little port and its rugged coastline, full of caves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you want to see the most beautiful sunsets of the Aeolian Islands, you must come with me to Pollara&rdquo;,
  recommends Santino Rossella, a policeman from Santa Marina Salina and a tour guide &ldquo;only for friends&rdquo;. The
  tiny village with its white houses extends on a plateau facing the sea, rocks overhanging the crystalline water. We are
  facing the remains of the largest crater of the Aeolian, a natural, gigantic amphitheater that, seen from the sea, is
  truly spectacular. Shy and reserved, little inclined to rowdy tourism, Salina is a cozy nest where you can rest, which
  seduces you little by little.</p>

  <p>And so, as the days went by, we became captivated by the beauties of nature and by the Aeolian architecture, by its
  simplicity and unpretentious rigor. We let ourselves be enchanted by the words of Lino Alcara, a refined antiquarian
  with a passion for gardening, or Donna Ida, who as a young woman&nbsp;emigrated to Australia, and whose personal
  relationship with God was marked by morning and evening masses.</p>

  <p>Every evening, we savored the dishes prepared by&nbsp;mamma Concetta at the A Cannata restaurant, which are based on
  traditions, and are cooked as they once were. We immersed ourselves in a reality made up of small gestures, encounters
  and chatter, magic and genuineness.</p>

  <p>N&auml;r Rolls-Royce best&auml;mde sig f&ouml;r att bygga en suv valde man att g&ouml;ra det p&aring; klassiskt
  Rolls-Roycevis, lyxigare, st&ouml;rre och b&auml;ttre &auml;n andra bilm&auml;rken kunnat dr&ouml;mma om. N&aring;got
  annat alternativ fanns inte med tanke p&aring; hur kontroversiellt beslutet m&aring;ste varit n&auml;r det v&auml;l togs
  att ett s&aring; anrikt m&auml;rke skulle ha en suv i sitt modellprogram.</p>

  <p>F&ouml;r att vara petiga kallar man heller inte Cullinan f&ouml;r suv utan f&ouml;r &ldquo;Offroad Capable
  Rolls-Royce&rdquo;. Med facit i hand kan vi konstatera att beslutet var korrekt.&nbsp;Bara i Sverige ligger det f&ouml;r
  tillf&auml;llet best&auml;llningar p&aring; 18 stycken Cullinan. Varje bil tar ett &aring;r fr&aring;n att man
  best&auml;llt den till leverans.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Sverige f&aring;r en tilldelning om &aring;tta bilar per &aring;r</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Varf&ouml;r man valt ett namn som Cullinan &auml;r givetvis ingen slump. Det kommer inte fr&aring;n n&aring;n ovanlig
  stormvind eller urtidsdjur, nej namnet kommer logiskt fr&aring;n den stora diamant med samma namn som ing&aring;r i de
  brittiska kronjuvelerna. Stenen hittades 1905 i Sydafrika och var d&aring; med sina 3106,75 carat den st&ouml;rsta som
  n&aring;gonsin hittats. Den kl&ouml;vs och delades upp i mindre diamanter och Cullinan I -IX ing&aring;r som sagt i de
  brittiska kronregalierna som idag &auml;r inl&aring;sta i Towern. 2013 v&auml;rderades Cullinan I till minst 450
  miljoner dollar.</p>

  <p>Cullinan &auml;r inte bara den f&ouml;rsta fyrhjulsdrivna bilen fr&aring;n Rolls-Royce, det &auml;r &auml;ven den
  f&ouml;rsta Rollsen som du kan f&auml;lla s&auml;tena p&aring;. F&ouml;r att vara exakt g&aring;r detta att g&ouml;ra
  med en 40/20/40 l&ouml;sning. Med samtliga s&auml;ten f&auml;lla sv&auml;ljer Cullinan totalt 1 930 liter. Den h&auml;r
  siffran &auml;r s&aring;klart helt ovidkommande d&aring; man sj&auml;lvklart utrustar sin Cullinan med &ldquo;Theatre
  Configuration&rdquo; som inneb&auml;r tv&aring; f&aring;t&ouml;ljer d&auml;r bak med inbyggd vinkyl mellan
  s&auml;tena.</p>

  <p>En annan viktig detalj ut&ouml;ver vinkyl man m&aring;ste utrusta sin Cullinan med &auml;r tillvalet &ldquo;Viewing
  Suite&rdquo;. Ett par praktiska l&auml;derkl&auml;dda picknick-stolar som f&auml;lls ut fr&aring;n den undre delen av
  den delade bakluckan. &Auml;ven den tv&aring;delande backluckan har f&aring;tt ett eget namn som lyder &ldquo;The
  Clasp&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>Bakom den klassiska och gigantiska kromade Rolls-Roycegrillen ruvar en juvel. Jag talar givetvis om V12-motorn
  p&aring; 6,75 liter. F&ouml;r att g&ouml;ra den extra effektiv &auml;r den utrustad med dubbla turboaggregat.
  Maxeffekten ligger p&aring; 571 h&auml;stkrafter och 850 newtonmeter i vridmoment. Det h&auml;r &auml;r samma motor som
  sitter i BMW 760 och det &auml;r ingen slump eftersom BMW &auml;ger Rolls Royce sedan 2003. Att snacka om 0-100 siffror
  f&ouml;r en Rolls f&aring;r n&auml;stan ses som oanst&auml;ndigt men n&auml;r vi &auml;nd&aring; &auml;r p&aring;
  &auml;mnet kan vi ju dela med oss.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Cullinan med sin tj&auml;nstevikt p&aring; 2 797 kilo klarar av att ta sig till hundrastrecket p&aring; bara 5,2
  sekunder</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Toppfarten &auml;r elektroniskt begr&auml;nsad till 250 km/h. Om man &ouml;vers&auml;tter dessa siffror till
  verklighet k&auml;nns Cullinan f&ouml;rst en aning klumpig men n&auml;r man v&auml;l trycker ner gaspedalen ordentligt
  &auml;r det som en helt ljudl&ouml;s urkraft v&auml;cks till liv. Precis s&aring; &auml;r och ska en Rolls Royce
  k&auml;nnas, kraften ska alltid finnas d&auml;r och bilen ska aldrig k&auml;nnas anstr&auml;ngd oavsett
  k&ouml;rf&ouml;rh&aring;llanden. L&auml;gg d&auml;rtill att Cullinan nu &auml;ven kan muta in det h&auml;r
  uppf&ouml;randet &auml;ven n&auml;r v&auml;gen knappt kan kallas v&auml;g l&auml;ngre. F&ouml;rh&aring;llandena som
  Cullinan testats i s&auml;gs vara gjorda p&aring; ett stort antal platser v&auml;rlden &ouml;ver med gott resultat.
  Sportknappar och dylikt har aldrig funnits i Rolls Royce bilar. I Cullinan d&auml;remot finns en Offroad-knapp som
  h&ouml;jer bilen med fyra centimeter. Markfrig&aring;ngen i normall&auml;get &auml;r 19 centimeter.</p>

  <p>Att Cullinan &auml;r en modell som s&auml;kerligen f&aring;r m&aring;nga trogna Rolls Roycekunder att vilja
  l&auml;mna m&auml;rket r&aring;der det nog ingen tvekan om. P&aring; samma vis som s&aring; m&aring;nga andra
  m&auml;rken vilka g&aring;tt emot sina genetiska riktm&auml;rken. Ta bara Porsche och deras modell Cayenne som p&aring;
  m&aring;nga vis tagit m&auml;rket dit dom &auml;r idag ekonomiskt. Om Cullinan kommer inneb&auml;ra ett lika stort lyft
  f&ouml;r m&auml;rket som Cayenne gjorde f&ouml;r Porsche &aring;terst&aring;r att se men troligen inte. En Rolls-Royce
  har alltid st&aring;tt h&ouml;gre i rangordningen &auml;n alla andra m&auml;rken och s&aring; g&ouml;r &auml;ven
  Cullinan med sin lyx, pris och storlek j&auml;mf&ouml;relse med alla andra suvar.</p>

One of the more difficult ones is when you choose to go with front-wheel
  drive. Enliven tested this hot-headed Korean machine on Gran Canaria.</p>

  <p>All car brands with some self-respect have a sportier line of models. Hyundai is of course not inferior and
  introduced its N-line as a concept at Frankfurt&#39;s Car Convention 2007. The first model to roll out on the roads was
  the Golf GTi Challenger i30 N. Now a new version of the same model has been released, but with a semi-hatch body.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The recipe is simple: turbo-driven engine, front wheel drive </em><em>and</em><em> manual box</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A recipe that is hard to accomplish without sacrificing enjoyment behind the wheel &mdash;&nbsp;above all for
  front-wheel-driven motor vehicles suffering from so-called &ldquo;torque-steer&rdquo;. In plain English, this means that
  the car gets choppy forward movement at full acceleration because it gets difficult to distribute force into the road in
  a controlled manner. A yardstick for a car successful in this category is the Renault Megan RS. Incredibly nice balance,
  steering and virtually no torque-steer at all.</p>

  <p>The engine of the Hyundai i30 Fastback N is a turbo-powered two-liter machine with 275 horsepower. There is also a
  weaker version with 250hp, but the one we tried is the former, with the optional extra &ldquo;Performance&rdquo;. Power
  is delivered to the front wheels via a manual six-speed box. The i30 Fastback N is not available in automatic or with a
  double clutch box &mdash; another reason why it is so fun. Certainly, it would be comfortable with a double clutch box
  but the sporty feeling of driving a car with a good manual gearbox is not comparable.</p>

  <p>In addition, Hyundai has been kind enough to&nbsp;put in a function that gives intermediate gas during downshifts to
  ensure that the revs match up with the selected gear (&ldquo;rev-matching&rdquo;). Something else you would otherwise
  need to execute with the toe-and-heel technique, which few drivers today can do with virtually everyone driving
  automatics.</p>

  <p>In addition to having the i30 Fastback N on a small but very fun track adjacent to the airport, a private road has
  also been closed for our disposal. Here the car really gets let loose. On the winding roads up along the cliff side and
  then down to the water again, we get the opportunity to without fear of traffic or police, get to know what the car is
  made of. And it really is impressive what Hyundai has succeeded in doing. The car is incredibly nice and well-balanced.
  The fact that it is such a fantastic machine is no coincidence; the i30 Fastback N is equipped with an electronic
  differential, the so-called &ldquo;E-LSD&rdquo;, which helps distribute the power between the wheels.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Hyundai has always had a hand in racing, giving them precious experience</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To optimize the driving experience there are, as with so many other cars, different driving modes. Hyundai calls it
  their &ldquo;Grind-Control System&rdquo;. With the button on the dial you can choose between Eco, Normal, Sport,
  N&nbsp;and N Custom. In the latter you have the maximum driving experience of the i30 Fastback N.</p>

  <p>If I had a passion for sporty and fun cars with front-wheel drive, the choice between a Megan RS or i30 Fastback N
  would be difficult. That Hyundai&#39;s getting into the competition with this kind of car is really fun, especially when
  considering that you see less and less of its kind.</p>

  Anders Melldén makes a journey from “then” to “now” in this wine country full of contrasts.</p>

  <p>Portuguese wine was for a long time tantamount to harsh bitterness and long storage potential - perhaps too long for
  its own good. With a not too distant military dictatorship when wine exports were not at the top of the agenda, several
  vineyards fell into oblivion, and in many places the vines were uprooted up in favor of cereal cultivation.</p>

  <p>Around the turn of the decade between the eighties and nineties something happened when a handful of producers
  managed to reach out with their products internationally. The game turned to modernized wines, more fruit-driven and
  easily accessible than before, often with international grape varieties, and at prices that appealed to many consumers.
  In particular, there were producers in wine areas near Lisbon and the Alentejo region driving the development, but also
  the Douro valley managed to keep up and deliver tasty, full-bodied table wines.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Today&#39;s Portuguese producers mix style and technology</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the early 2000s, a new wave of producers in the export market made themselves known to the world, this time with
  slightly more exclusive wines in more stylish bottles. The international grape varieties were still included in the
  wines, but a pride in the domestic varieties also emerged. The respect for the old and endangered species has also
  recently led to an increase in the number of wine lovers once again setting their eyes on old-fashioned style wines,
  made to last a long time in the cellar.</p>

  <p>To get a better understanding of the different styles of Portuguese wine, I went out on a wine tour from
  &ldquo;then&rdquo; to &ldquo;now&rdquo;, a journey that proved to be easier said than done. This time, we skip the
  celebrity-regions Douro, Minho and Alentejo, and make a tour that begins with a more historical tone in Bairrada and
  ends with the latest in Lisbon wine bars.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>Tradition at the Bu&ccedil;aco Palace Hotel</strong></em></p>

  <p>I am joined at the hotel by Zurich&#39;s Porsche club. We and another handful of tourists have managed to take the
  bumpy roads up to Bu&ccedil;aco Palace Hotel in the border&nbsp;between the wine regions of Bairrada and D&atilde;o.</p>

  <p>The Porsche Club has parked their cars right next to the hotel&#39;s outdoor dining area. I put my rented Opel Corsa
  a bit further away. Apart from the guests&#39; cars, there is not much here that hints that we are in the present day.
  The hotel, once&nbsp;a royal palace, sits in a formerly monastic area dating back to the 17th century at the top of
  Serra do Bu&ccedil;aco. The brochure found in the room presents a quite limited but highly focused&nbsp;&ldquo;must
  do&#39;s&rdquo;, namely to walk in the hotel park or in the surrounding forests.</p>

  <p>The wonderfully ornate lobby and stairwell &mdash;with its tiled artwork, suits of armor, and furniture you can&#39;t
  sit in&mdash;&nbsp;leads your thoughts far back in history. At the same time, the Bu&ccedil;aco Palace Hotel has proper
  and stylish service, a couple of lovely common rooms, outdoor caf&eacute;s and a restaurant.</p>

  <p>Some of the guest rooms are quite luxurious, but most are nothing to write home about. You can tell it was a long
  time since any renovation was done, and although they&rsquo;re spacious, there is nothing to encourage you to spend too
  much time in them. Instead, there are two things that attract attention:&nbsp;the food and the wines. It is for the
  latter I am here - they have the privilege of offering vintages hard to find elsewhere.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>What makes me curious is not a particular&nbsp;selection but the way they store their own house wine, in much the
  same way as in the early 1900s</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I meet with Ant&oacute;nio Rocha, wine manager for the hotel. He says that the owning family De Almeida&nbsp;always
  had the ambition to create a substantial wine collection, inspired by luxury hotels in France and Italy. Back in the
  day, the wines came from their own vineyard, and in the basement, there&nbsp;are vintages dating back to the 1940s.</p>

  <p>As mentioned, the range is limited - a red wine of the grape varieties Touriga Nacional, best known in D&atilde;o and
  Douro, and Baga, Bairrada&#39;s &ldquo;own&rdquo;&nbsp;grape. White wine is also made, a mixture of the lesser-known
  varieties Maria Gomes, Encruzado&nbsp;and Bical. Nowadays, the wines are made by a number of different producers, and
  Ant&oacute;nio Rocha, therefore, sees himself only partly as a winemaker, even though he is part of the process.</p>

  <p>To make the red wine, the grapes are trodden in&nbsp;<em>lagares</em>&nbsp;- large open vessels, in true Old
  Portuguese fashion. They are then stored in three hundred-liter barrels of new French oak. The Baga grape makes up the
  largest share of the blend, which gives the wine its characteristic tenderness. The mixture with the generously fruity
  Touriga Nacional gives it yet a few more taste points. The white wine also gets to soak in the oak barrels, for about a
  year, which makes it wonderfully rustic with hints of honey and fresh fruit. In fact, it is the white that is most
  impressive with its traditional and timeless style.</p>

  <p>The fact that the hotel has produced just these two wines simply depends on the fact that they were made to match the
  hotel&#39;s food, something I notice when I settle down in the beautiful royal dining room&nbsp;with its wooden ornate
  ceiling. The last rays of the sun are coming down between the trees outside, but the dining room is properly lit in the
  usual southern European way. After a glass of fresh sparkling Bairradine, I am surprised by the quality of the food.
  Despite the somewhat old-timey charm of the hotel, the flavors here are quite modern.</p>

  <p>Among silver cutlery, middle-aged men in colorful chinos, and some Asian tourists, I enjoy a perfectly poached egg on
  sour artichoke and al dente beans. Later, a duck with a perfect pink hue with traditional creamy gratin is paired with
  the thirteen-year-old white house wine &ndash; the match is made in heaven. It complements the meal perfectly making up
  for the almost-but-not-quite perfect service.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>D&atilde;o &ndash; the region that missed the train</strong></em></p>

  <p>After a night in the palace, I head a bit further inland. Just over an hour&#39;s drive from Serra do Bu&ccedil;aco
  lies the small sleepy village of Santar in the middle of the D&atilde;o wine region. Previously, the region was known as
  &ldquo;Portugal&#39;s Bordeaux&rdquo;&nbsp;thanks to all the small wine producers, but in recent decades most of the
  grapes have gone to cooperatives. This has led to the fact that many wines from here today are sold very cheaply,
  perhaps too cheaply for all the growers to earn their keep.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Casa de Santar&nbsp;is one of the few producers established fairly well in the Swedish market</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The wine house has been owned by the same family since the 19th century, and in the spring of this year the
  Countess&nbsp;of Vasconcellos died, the last of the family to live in the beautiful whitewashed stone house on the main
  street. Today Casa de Santar is part of D&atilde;o Sul, a large company that owns several producers in six different
  regions in Portugal, as well as in Brazil.</p>

  <p>Luis Santos is a winemaker, and he says that the D&atilde;o producers generally slumbered through the big wine
  revolution that took place in other parts of Portugal around the beginning of the 1990s. Something that made it miss the
  train to international fame, but it is now well on track to catch up. Today, D&atilde;o is dominated by a handful of
  large producers, but also many little ones are doing their best to enter the market.</p>

  <p>It is hot and sunny in the vineyards while the high altitude of several hundred meters above sea level, near the
  Serra da Estrella, makes it somewhat breezy. This gives freshness and elegance to the wines, something that
  distinguishes D&atilde;o&#39;s wines from the slightly richer ones of the neighbor Douro. The red wines are dominated by
  Touriga Nacional while the whites are often made by Encruzado mixed with other grape varieties. Casa de Santar&#39;s
  wines are best tried at the wine house&#39;s own restaurant, which serves really good food.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>Wine history in Colares</strong></em></p>

  <p>It&#39;s time to continue the journey, and I head south. Although I am approaching the capital, I am on my way to
  Colares, a small wine region,&nbsp;perhaps the country&#39;s most traditional and historically interesting, which is
  also now being rediscovered by young sommeliers around the world.</p>

  <p>The wine region of Lisbon was formerly called Estremadura and the new name is slightly misleading. The region covers
  the entire nine DOPs (recognized wine regions) and stretches&nbsp;from the capital to as far south as Leiria. Little DOP
  Colares is located on the coast, just outside the tourist magnet Sintra. The journey from D&atilde;o takes just under
  three hours on the motorway, and from Lisbon it takes about an hour including&nbsp;the serpentine roads down to the
  sea.</p>

  <p>Colares is a wine region different from all the others. There are only a few wine producers&nbsp;storing and bottling
  wine. The reds of the Ramisco-grape and the whites of Malvasia, are often rustic-tasting that can withstand a long time
  in the cellar. That&#39;s why you can find really old vintages here.</p>

  <p>That is not the only peculiarity of this small region, you also have the old vineyards &ndash; walled lots of sandy
  soil by the sea where some vines literally stretch along the ground. Traditionally, the stalks aren&#39;t bound, and the
  sandy soil that allows the roots to move far into the ground has made the vines resistant to the pest Phylloxera, which
  has ravaged virtually the entire wine world. This, in turn, means that grafting from pest-resistant American roots has
  not been necessary.</p>

  <p>Now, it should be said that Colares wines don&#39;t necessarily have to come from untied stalks, but the vines must
  have grown in the special sandy soils. Nowadays, there are also growers who tie up their tendrils to make them easier to
  handle.</p>

  <p>In the square of the small village of Almo&ccedil;ageme I meet Jos&eacute; Baeta who owns Adega Vi&uacute;va Gomes,
  dating back to the 19th century. His family took over the cellar in 1988 but has made wine in the area for much longer.
  Baeta says that in the past, the stalks of the red wine were allowed to be present throughout the leaching and
  fermentation process to provide extra tannins. Today&nbsp;some adjustments have been made, and in his wines now only
  one-third of the stems must be included.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>I buy a bottle of 1969&#39;s red for 55&euro;, and a white from the same year for 15&euro;: cheap money for a
  bottle of unique wine history</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The storage has also undergone some modernization, nowadays French oak is used for a first six-month barrel storage,
  after which the wine is traditionally located in larger vessels for four years. The result is a wine that has rustic
  spice with elements of iodine, tobacco and cherry.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>Portugal&#39;s winning </strong></em><em><strong>star</strong></em></p>

  <p>Seeking a contrast to the&nbsp;Colares&#39; region I now&nbsp;head to Alenquer, an hour&#39;s drive north from
  Lisbon. Here Sandra Tavares da Silva&#39;s family makes their wine. Sandra is known as Portugal&#39;s young hot-shot in
  the wine world and today also runs the winery in Douro along with her husband. A few days a week&nbsp;she spends time in
  the family winery Quinta de Chocapalha, which she started with her father Paulo, mother Alice and sister Andrea. One can
  safely say that Quinta de Chocapalha has helped raise the bar of modern Portuguese winemaking both through its wines and
  through the personal involvement of its members.</p>

  <p>With its stylish labels and easy-to-drink wines,&nbsp;Quinta de Chocapalha is a state-of-the-art facility. But the
  facility is only a couple of years old. Before that, the wines were made in a rural property consisting of a handful of
  stone houses that the family bought in 1987. At the time it was an abandoned and mismanaged vineyard, but after a little
  persuasion from newly trained winemaker Sandra, the family acquired it and was able to produce wine from the early
  2000s. The family now has 40 hectares of vineyard here, planting mainly the Touriga Nacional and Aragonez grape
  varieties, but also international varieties such as Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. The latter yields a wine that has been
  selling well at Systembolaget for some years. White wines are also made from Arinto, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay.</p>

  <p>Andrea lets me try the first made vintage of the Arintovine, vintage 2003, which has a surprising freshness and
  acidity despite its age, and developed tones that almost resemble the rippling grape&#39;s petroleum character. Cool!
  The fantastic red wine CH is made exclusively from Touriga Nacional and is a prime example of grape complexity and
  perfumed fruitiness. As mentioned, the winemaking technique is state-of-the-art, but inevitably the Portuguese tradition
  creeps in, an example being the mechanical treading&nbsp;in shiny stainless steel <em>lagares</em>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>New meets old at&nbsp;</strong><strong>By The Wine</strong></em></p>

  <p>The last stop of the trip is the capital, Lisbon. On the other side of the beautiful modernist bridge is the
  Set&uacute;bal Peninsula and here, in the small town of Azeit&atilde;o, lies the family property of Jos&eacute; Maria da
  Fonseca which, under present ownership, the brother-duo Ant&oacute;nio and Domingos Soares Franco, has become synonymous
  with international wine success. Da Fonseca was a very important player in Portugal&#39;s wine-boom in the eighties and
  nineties, but the fact is that the house products, such as the sweet Alambre Moscatel de Set&uacute;bal wine, the
  rediscovered Amphora-made Alentejo wines and great-selling Periquita have a long history. But through a combination of
  stylish presentation, reasonable pricing and a charismatic owning family, the brothers have succeeded in getting lots of
  consumers to open their eyes to Portuguese wine. Not least in Sweden.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Wine&nbsp;by the glass, oysters, small dishes and cheeses</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The latest addition to further strengthening the brand is the wine bar that was recently opened in Lisbon&#39;s old
  quarter. The bar By The Wine&nbsp;is a kind of showroom for the company&#39;s various wines, and during my visit,
  well-dressed but festive Portuguese people are crowded under the old stone arches where the ceilings are covered with
  bottles.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It is the first wine bar in Portugal of its kind owned by a wine producer. Ant&oacute;nio Soares Franco&nbsp;tells
  us, while we are testing some different wines and dishes at the bar counter, that the project has turned out very well.
  And that doesn&#39;t surprise me. Thanks to the company&#39;s broad selection of wines from several different regions,
  the wine list does not feel lacking.</p>

  <p>By The Wine&nbsp;works just as well as a bar-hop stop, as a venue to spend the entire evening. A place where modern
  Portugal&#39;s wine culture harmonizes with its history and tradition in a relaxed way. It also feels like a
  distillation of this trip: Portugal is a new wine country with a very old history, where &ldquo;then&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;now&rdquo; have fused together to a complete unit.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/wine/wine-adventure-central-portugal</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/wine/wine-adventure-central-portugal</guid><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2019 09:03:02 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Anders Melldén</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chanterelle Soup with Bacon Pangrattato]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Treat yourself to a good, warm soup prepared with chanterelles or funnel chanterelles.</p>

Here is the answer: a stronger, faster
  and more expensive one! Let's introduce the Koenigsegg Jesko.</p>

  <p>Rumors that a new Koenigsegg model would be introduced during the 2019 Geneva Car Show have been circulating for
  quite some time. The consensus has been that it would be a cheaper entry model with a hybrid drive train called
  Ragnar&ouml;k. But how wrong we &ndash; and everyone else &ndash; were!</p>

  <p>Just a week before the Geneva Car Show, Enliven, together with a few leading car magazines and channels, were invited
  down to the Koenigsegg factory in &Auml;ngelholm, Sweden to get an exclusive preview of the Koenigsegg Jesko.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The family sold their house in Stockholm to support Christians vision of building a super sports car</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The story of Koenigsegg began in 1994 when the company was founded by Christian von Koenigsegg, then only 22 years
  old. Already from the start his parents, mother Brita and father Jesko von Koenigsegg, played a key role in getting
  Koenigsegg Automotive off the ground. Their unwavering support to their son Christian went all the way.</p>

  <p>At one point, when the company ran out money, the family sold their house in Stockholm to continue to support
  Christian&#39;s vision of building a super sports car as had never before been seen. With his parents&#39; support, and
  a 1.5 billion deal with Chinese company Nevs,&nbsp;the decision to sell their house was the right one.</p>

  <p>As a tribute to Jesko&#39;s unwavering commitment and support, Christian has therefore chosen to name the new car
  after his father - the Koenigsegg Jesko!</p>

  <p>The working name in the development phase has been &quot;Dominera&quot; which, when translated into English, means
  &ldquo;to dominate&rdquo;. Without Jesko&#39;s knowledge, and to his great surprise, Christian unveiled the car&rsquo;s
  real name. In another specific tribute to Jesko, the exhibition car in Geneva is white with green elements, the same
  colors as the Koenigsegg family racing horse stable.</p>

  <p>Rumors are always plenty when it comes to a company like Koenigsegg, and recently the rumors have been more
  imaginative than usual. Most recently the grapevine has carried a story about a cheaper entry model with the name
  Ragnar&ouml;k running on a hybrid drivetrain.</p>

  <p>Instead, we got the Jesko. A few quick highlights include a 5 liter V8 with a dual turbocharger that, with a tank
  filled with E85 delivers 1600 horsepower, adding new aerodynamic technology that creates a downforce of over 1000 kilos.
  A new 9-step double clutch gearbox called Koenigsegg Light Speed Transmission (LST) and&nbsp;four-wheel steering. The
  carbon fiber chassis is redesigned for more space, a prerequisite for even taller customers to fit in the car.</p>

  <p>No exact performance figures have yet been presented, but after a conversation with the Koenigsegg test driver Niklas
  Lilja, we can look forward to impressive numbers for both straight-line and the race track. Niklas should know, as he
  was behind the wheel whilst beating the record for the fastest serial-produced passenger car on a public road at 457.49
  km/h in the Nevada desert.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Its new aerodynamic technology creates a downforce of over 1000 kilos</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The all-new V8 engine with a dual turbocharger is impressive. New technology for the flat crankshaft (flat plane) has
  brought the weight down only 12.5 kilograms, making it the world&#39;s lightest. This in turn means that you can get
  more power and a higher revolution, now at 8500 rpm before redline.</p>

  <p>The new and larger turbo units have an air injection that increases the efficiency dramatically. The technique
  involves injecting air with a pressure of 20 bar directly into the turbo, via a compressor, from a carbon fiber tank.
  The result is that the so-called &rdquo;turbo lag&quot; is completely absent.</p>

  <p>On the regular 95-octane gasoline, the engine delivers 1280 horsepower, but if you fill the tank with the E85 this
  increases the power to 1,600 horses and an insane torque of 1500 Newton.</p>

  <p>To bring down all that power to the tires, a gearbox is needed which is truly something extra. Therefore, Jesko&#39;s
  drive train is based on a completely new, self-developed dual-clutch box named LST (Light Speed Transmission). What is
  unique and different compared to conventional dual-clutch boxes is that the LST can change &ldquo;step-less&rdquo;
  between the gears, that is, not gear shifting as normal. Shifting gears at the speed of light, hence the name.</p>

  <p>In addition, the weight of the gearbox has been reduced from normal 140 kg to just 90 kg. Another completely new
  technique for keeping the weight down is the ultra-light, hollow, 20-inch carbon fiber rims. The technique how to make
  them hollow is secret, but the result is amazing, with a weight of just 7.4 kg for the rear and 5.9 kg in the front. A
  fun detail is that when they developed and calculated the weight for these rims, it was found that when the final rim
  was finished, it weighed an entire kilo less - important kilos when it comes to a car like this.</p>

  <p>Jesko is supposed to be even more of a race track oriented car than Koenigsegg has ever sold. Therefore, more
  downward force is required. To achieve this, completely new technology has been developed for Jesko.</p>

  <p>The huge rear wing at the back is the first evidence of this. The wing is active, as are the flaps underneath which
  adjust automatically to different speeds, in order to push the car down toward the asphalt. The result is a ground
  pressure of 800 kg at 250 km/h, rising to an amazing 1000 kg at 275 km/h.</p>

  <p>By comparison, this is 30% more than the weight/power monster One:1 and 40% more than the Agera RS with which Niklas
  crushed previous speed records. At speeds above 350 km/h hour, a ground pressure of over 1500 kilos will be developed at
  Jesko.</p>

  <p>With all this downforce previous models with more than 1000 horsepower have tended to lower the front where the
  pressure is at its highest. Imagine that an elephant has suddenly sat down on the bonnet at full speed.</p>

  <p>For Jesko, a so-called triplex system has been introduced, which technically consists of a third damper front that
  prevents the car from dipping forwards when the pressure is at its most. Even the rear carriage is equipped with this
  system and together with the new four-wheel steering, Jesko will be extremely stable even at the top speeds about which
  we have so far only been able to speculate.</p>

  <p>However, when it comes to Jesko it&#39;s not just about numbers, performance and total control. Comfort is also of
  the utmost importance. One related technology that was introduced with the Regera is Koenigsegg Technology Autoskin
  which lets you open all doors and hoods electronically using the key.</p>

  <p>Jesko has also divided front and rear parts into two pieces for smoother and cheaper replacement if an accident were
  to occur. In order not to try to hide this, one has tastefully put a chrome strip over the entire car between the two
  parties.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>150 will&nbsp;be manufactured and pre-orders are already at 90 cars</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The patented door opening technology system has also been updated, and the doors now open slightly diagonally
  upwards, something that now makes all the faulty constructed and high curbs safe when you park your Koenigsegg Jesko and
  open the door. Among other completely new features are the steering wheel, Koenigsegg SmartWheel, and the instrument
  screen behind it.</p>

  <p>At Jesko, the screen sits firmly in the steering wheel and follows it when the steering wheel is turned. In order to
  still be able to see what is on the digital 5-inch screen, the content turns when turning the steering wheel so that it
  always maintains a horizontal line.</p>

  <p>Another new aspect is the controls on the steering wheel spokes, which are now two digital touchscreens. On these you
  can control several traditional functions such as volume, telephone and the car&#39;s lift system, as well as change the
  contents.</p>

  <p>Even the center console is completely new to Jesko, and all systems nowadays like Tesla can be updated wirelessly via
  Koenigsegg Cloud, a cloud function. To meet all markets and make Jesko available everywhere, it has been adopted for
  both the US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.</p>

  <p>The fact that demand is great is not in any doubt. The number of Jesko to be manufactured is 150 and the pre-orders
  are already at 90 cars, a figure that, when considering a price tag of about three million US dollars, is
  impressive.</p>

  <p>In Jesko, the former small car company from &Auml;ngelholm once again pushes the boundaries of what is possible in
  the automotive industry. Koenigsegg is no longer a small company and, with the sale of one fifth of the shares to
  Chinese Nevs, we will see much more from them in the future. Christian says, however, that Jesko is probably the last
  completely refined fossil-driven car they will produce. If this is true or not, the only thing of interest right now is
  how Jesko performs when we get to see this creation on the road.</p>

If you are waking up in Cape Town, that good news might have to do with
  the waves.</p>

  <p><em><strong>10:00 am.</strong> </em></p>

  <p>I get the call.&nbsp;I get the nod, from Craig, an avid surfer and fisherman.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sunset Reef is working
  today, do you wanna come?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; This is one of the premiere big surf breaks in Cape Town.</p>

  <p>Craig proceeds to tell me that he needs to run his engines on his boat for the upcoming tuna season. At this point I
  really don&#39;t care, I just want to be on this boat and up close to this wave I&#39;ve never experienced. Besides, it
  saved me from a boozy Saturday lunch.</p>

  <p><em><strong>12:00 am.</strong> </em></p>

  <p>I surfed when I was younger and still an avid follower living vicariously through others, but now it is me and
  photography. After getting my gear together, the trusty 70/200 (at times a 400 would have been nice) and my MK2 Canon, I
  meet up with Craig in Hout Bay, we are dragged to the water from the boatyard by our best friend the tractor and we are
  off. Cool, now I&#39;m off to see Sunset Reef up close and personal. Craig tells me, as we get to optimal speed, that
  the swell will pick up this afternoon. Being close to a big wave for my first time, the nerves jump&nbsp;a notch,
  knowing it&#39;s&nbsp;going to be not big, but bigger. &ldquo;Eisch&rdquo;... But hey, we are here to document a
  moment.</p>

  <p>Sunset Reef and its neighbor, Dungeons, with its ever-lurking shark looking to snack on a seal, are two of Cape
  Town&#39;s formidable breaks which both have a reputation for big wave surfing.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Getting to Sunset Reef from Kommetjie you have a one-kilometer&nbsp;paddle before
  getting</em><em>started,</em><em> unless you have the luxury of a boat or jet ski</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It&#39;s a break that can be surfed by paddle-in or tow-in and the surfers are looking for 20 feet waves and above to
  satisfy those crazy needs.</p>

  <p>There are some crazy waves around South Africa, but that&#39;s another episode. The many aspects of big wave surfing,
  for me, are inspirational and scary at the same time and on that day we captured some moments from these fearless
  individuals at an awesome break. South Africa has a list of big wave surfers with Grant Baker from Durban SA,&nbsp;a
  big&nbsp;contender on the WSL Big Wave Tour 2019 and going strong - go &#39;Twiggy&#39;!</p>

  <p><em><strong>1:00 pm.</strong> </em></p>

  <p>So we arrive at Sunset Reef&nbsp;and it&#39;s looking good! The first thing that comes to mind about this wave,
  besides their sheer size and power, is how &#39;loud&#39; they are. Just to add to the list of intimidating aspects of
  Big Wave Surfing, the thought of&nbsp;swimming around in that turbulent white water&nbsp;is just terrifying.</p>

  <p>We cruised up and down the break for the rest of the afternoon enjoying the spectacle, while putting the Canon to
  work. What an awesome day, some spectacular wipeouts and epic rides, but the day had to end at some point and with that,
  we headed back to Hout Bay for the comforts of land.</p>

  <p><em><strong>4:00 pm.</strong> </em></p>

  <p>Back in Hout Bay, sipping on a cold one... Until next time!</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/outdoor-health-outdoor/lucky-call-surf-south-africa</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/outdoor-health-outdoor/lucky-call-surf-south-africa</guid><category><![CDATA[Outdoor]]></category><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2019 14:01:26 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Damon Fourie</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ferrari GTC4 Lusso — A Ferrari For All Types of Weather]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Has the family grown and you still want to speed around in a car with a fantastic <span class="caps">V12</span> with
  a stallion on the emblem? Then the <span class="caps">GTC4</span> Lusso is for you.</p>

  <p>There is nothing sensational that Ferrari has built V12-equipped four-seaters. Already in 1972, the model 400i was
  presented -&nbsp;a four-seater with 2-wheel drive. In 2011 the model FF was released which ended up being a modest
  sensation. So in other words, the four-wheel drive should still be considered fairly uncharted territory when it comes
  to Ferrari.</p>

  <p>The model FF, the 4WD predecessor of the GTC4 Lusso, was the first Ferrari to be fitted with the company&acute;s own
  (and somewhat unique) patented four-wheel drive systems. What sets it apart from other&nbsp;drive systems is that, just
  like in the GTC4 Lusso, the front wheel drive is disengaged when the fifth gear or higher is engaged.</p>

  <p>The simple explanation for this setup is that the power to the rear wheels are supplied in a conventional manner via
  a transaxle from the rear of the engine while the front wheels are powered from the front of the engine. The power to
  the front wheels is distributed via a two-speed box and two wet-plate couplings.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The machine has nerves of steel, keeping with the Ferrari tradition</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What is also completely new, which was introduced already with the FF, is the so-called
  &ldquo;shooting-break-body&rdquo;. The simple translation would be to say that it&acute;s a combi, but that is
  definitely a word Ferrari does not want to be associated with. What this ends up meaning in practice is that you can fit
  four people plus a few bags without having to squeeze them in too tight.</p>

  <p>However, we are not talking about luggage for the whole family on their way to a three-week ski holiday. If you end
  up being just two in the car, you can&nbsp;pack quite comfortably. Maximum luggage volume is 800 liters, which is in
  line with a midsized family car. If you want to optimize your packing, you can buy the specially sewn bags from Schedon.
  Just keep in mind that this will run you the same cost as buying a small car.</p>

  <p>The crown jewel in the GTC4 Lusso is the 690-horsepower V12 engine. This is an engine that creates emotions
  throughout all gears. It can be low-key and discreet and change character in just a fraction of a second to a
  high-performance wolf that awakens everything in its path. When the RPMs exceed 5,000 revs, every single hair stands to
  attention. When driving this machine in the wet and cold, not giving it your all isn&acute;t good enough.</p>

  <p>Despite four-wheel drive and systems to keep the car on the road, you still have to watch out for the car&acute;s
  rear which has a tendency to rock back and forth. This may be perceived as a negative, but personally, I think it is
  quite liberating. Too many performance cars have become too&nbsp;easy to drive, so easy that most anybody&acute;s
  grandma could drive one without a second thought. No, a Ferrari, even the ones under the labels &ldquo;family&quot; and
  &quot;all-year-around&rdquo;, should have a little personality and some bite.</p>

  <p>Because I don&rsquo;t have the pleasure of driving a Ferrari every day, the knobs and controls take some time to get
  used to, especially when considering that their layout doesn&acute;t resemble that of any other manufacturer. However,
  with some practice, you easily get the hang of things.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The GTC4 Lusso is the answer</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A cool detail for the passenger is that you have a display in front of which you can control certain fucntions as
  well as display current performance information, speed and much more. Like most cars nowadays, the GTC4 Lusso has Apple
  CarPlay that makes it easy to connect your iPhone to the car. In fact, Ferrari was among the first car brands to
  introduce Apple CarPlay in the model FF before the GTC4 Lusso even came out.</p>

  <p>As mentioned before, Ferrari&acute;s aren&rsquo;t cars meant to run all year or day-to-day. With the GTC4 Lusso one
  of these things becomes a notion of the past, but unfortunately though not the latter. But the feasibility of taking
  your Ferrari on a coast-to-coast road trip, down to the Riviera or up into the mountains is now a fact.</p>

A great
  manor, and yet the best is the garden that surrounds it, perfectly planned to amaze its guests at any season of the
  year.  </p>

  <p>Paul Bangay would have to be Australia&#39;s best-known landscape designer.&nbsp;This is his own country garden, at
  Denver, a tiny hamlet in the central Victorian countryside. A&nbsp;place where he can experiment with new ideas and
  plants, and also different planting techniques.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>You really feel&nbsp;in the Australian countryside as you drive down the road&nbsp;and see a mob of twenty
  kangaroos lounging by a dam</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Paul has published ten books over the last twenty years. The latest, &ldquo;Paul Bangay&#39;s&nbsp;Small
  Gardens&rdquo;&nbsp;will be out ay any time. It is&nbsp;a book on about forty-five of Paul&#39;s favorite small gardens
  that he has designed, from rooftop city gardens to small innercity courtyards, terraces and tiny balcony gardens, the
  ideas behind the designs and how he solves problems with difficult sites and locations for gardens for his
  clients.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>At Stonefields there are no such restraints and the garden has developed and flourished over the years. The garden is
  divided into rooms and it spills down the hill from the carpark to the house. Beyond the house, the garden goes on
  with&nbsp;a pool terrace with an incredible 180-degree view of the local countryside, an ornamental vine-covered arbor
  for long country lunches, and still the garden continues to spill down the hill.</p>

  <p>The garden rooms allow different areas of the garden to be quite separate from each other and&nbsp;have a different
  feeling. The walled rose garden is divided into four large beds with a rather beautiful statue that Paul bought many
  years ago from a local wrecking yard; it had been salvaged from an old building and now in spring wears a cloak of
  wisteria flowers. Paul has made very clever support behind the statue to accommodate&nbsp;a wisteria.</p>

  <p>Other rooms&nbsp;include a white garden, a circular woodland garden, a herb garden and at the top, an intimate garden
  room with a circular hole cut into the private hedge that gives a perfectly framed view of the country house.</p>

  <p>A water&nbsp;rill runs down from the top of the garden to the house and draws the viewer down the steps through
  borders of summer-flowering perennials to the apple walk and small champagne houses. From there we go to a parterre of
  English box cut in circles and squares, which are filled with hundreds of black and white tulips in spring, and from
  this point we arrive at the house.&nbsp;Beyond the house is a large productive vegetable garden that Paul&#39;s gardener
  maintains so there is always fresh fruit and vegetables for the house.</p>

  <p>Stonefields&nbsp;has been designed so that there is always something of interest in the garden, no matter what time
  of the year. From the height of the hot Australian summer and overflowing perennial borders full of color, to autumn
  when berries and seeds fill the&nbsp;trees and their&nbsp;change of color puts on a show. Even in&nbsp;winter when the
  structure of the garden is laid bare, the hedges turn to&nbsp;mellow bronze color&nbsp;and are&nbsp;often dusted with
  snow.&nbsp;In spring the garden comes to life and bulbs and wisterias fill the air with scent&nbsp;and the golden new
  growth on the English box gives the garden yet another different look.</p>

  <p>Stonefields is usually open one weekend a year for the public to go and enjoy the garden. If you are keen enough to
  see Paul&#39;s garden, you can book into his B&amp;B &ldquo;The Farmhouse&rdquo;&nbsp;as guests are allowed a private
  tour of the garden, and this is the best way to see it in all its glory without thousands of other people. Stonefields
  is a magical garden at any time of the year and quite inspiring, full of ideas you can translate to your own garden.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/garden-australia-stonefields-seasons</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/garden/garden-australia-stonefields-seasons</guid><category><![CDATA[Garden]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2019 14:00:05 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Simon Griffiths</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kamchatka — The Peninsula of Fire and Ice]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Photographer Frederik Schenholm and skier Oscar Hübinette traveled to Kamchatka with the goal of taking a ski trip
  with volcanic eruptions as a backdrop. It became an adventure that offered lava, cyclones, and a rescue mission.</p>

  <p>We are sitting in a large orange-blue Russian transport helicopter of the type MI8.&nbsp;At the horizon lies the
  active volcano&nbsp;Tolbachik&nbsp;with its white&nbsp;steam plume&nbsp;rising straight up into the sky.&nbsp;Below us,
  an alpine volcanic landscape spreads out with white snow, black ash and red-glowing flows of lava that curl down one of
  the twenty-nine active volcanoes.&nbsp;Enthrallingly beautiful and dangerous.</p>

  <p>We fly east and feel the cold wind and hear the rotor blades ear-deafening roar through the open windows in the
  helicopter.&nbsp;After a week off off-piste skiing and easier summit trips around the ski resort Moroznaya, local
  king&nbsp;crab&nbsp;and vodka dinners, as well as hanging in depressing concrete cities like Yelizovo&nbsp;and
  Petropavlovs, the adventure of real&nbsp;volcano skiing&nbsp;we have come here to experience finally seems to
  start.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We land at the foot of&nbsp;Tolbachik,&nbsp;which rises&nbsp;3,682&nbsp;meters above sea level, and unpack all the
  equipment where we intend to make our base camp.&nbsp;The tent camp consists of us two Swedish skiers, who are here on
  our own, and the Russian guide Alexander &ldquo;Sasha&rdquo;&nbsp;Bichenko, responsible for
  the&nbsp;Tolbachik&nbsp;park, with his three clients.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Sasha walks towards the lava flow, a couple of hundred meters from the helicopter landing site</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Red-orange flowing lava in a river of molten stone.&nbsp;The air trembles with the heat, our faces burn; we smell
  sulfur and a bit of fart.&nbsp;Sasha has brought an iron skewer and sticks it down into the red flow and fishes up a
  lump of lava, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it was a dollop of honey.&nbsp;With the skewer at shoulder height and the lava in front of
  him, he moves towards a regular solid stone and smears the lava on it.&nbsp;He pushes down a coin.&nbsp;Waits a few
  minutes.&nbsp;The lava rock solidifies in the Russian winter cold. Left is a stone with a coin in the middle. He smiles
  at us.</p>

  <p>During the time that Sasha has worked on his coin cast, his boots have begun to melt from the heat, as has his
  clients&rsquo;.&nbsp;Sasha turns to us and smiles even more - an infectiously childish smile.&nbsp;It&#39;s hard to
  understand that this fifty-year-old man climbed Mount&nbsp;Everest.</p>

  <p>A more nearby mountain that he has climbed is 4,750 meters high&nbsp;Kljutyevskaya Sopka&nbsp;- the highest of
  Kamchatka&#39;s 160 volcanoes.&nbsp;When he was at the top, the volcano got a minor eruption.&nbsp;Sasha was hit by the
  stone rain which knocked out a few teeth.&nbsp;When he tells us the story, he just laughs.</p>

  <p>When the evening falls over the volcano landscape we go up to&nbsp;Tolbachik&#39;s&nbsp;active crater.&nbsp;With the
  darkness, the colors of the ongoing eruption have emerged - red, orange and various shades in between.&nbsp;We stand
  silent in the Russian night as the magma pushing up through the crater inside the mountain with a growl.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>When the molten stone splashes out of the crater, it geologically speaking becomes lava and it is finding its way
  down the mountain rock like red blood vessels.&nbsp;It is an experience of nature at its most raw.&nbsp;A creative
  process.&nbsp;Melted stone.&nbsp;Heat.&nbsp;Hell.&nbsp;Earth&#39;s bowels. We are not looking through a TV
  screen.&nbsp;We are in Kamchatka in the corner of northeast Asia far from home.</p>

  <p>There is a story of explorers on the Kamchatka Peninsula well before our journey. Vladimir Vasilyevich
  Atlasov&nbsp;was a poor farmer&#39;s son from western Russia, who, along with his Siberian Cossacks, fought and explored
  the peninsula in the late 17th century.&nbsp;For his conquest of Kamchatka, Atlasov&nbsp;was appointed governor of the
  peninsula in 1707.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In 1740, the Danish explorer Vitus Bering went to the peninsula on behalf of the Russian fleet and founded the city
  of Petropavlovsk.&nbsp;After World War II, Kamchatka became a closed military zone.&nbsp;When the Berlin Wall and then
  the Soviet Union collapsed in the late 1980s, Kamchatka was opened for domestic tourists, and since the early 1990s
  foreigners with valid visas are also welcome.&nbsp;There are almost twenty thousand tourists every year, basically
  always through a local tourist office.</p>

  <p>Our own journey is of a different kind.&nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t have a budget that suited organized&nbsp;heli-skiing, we
  didn&rsquo;t want to fish any of Kamchatka&#39;s innumerable species of salmon or meet brown bears.&nbsp;After seeing
  the Kamchatka section in the nature series &ldquo;The Wild Russia&rdquo;&nbsp;which showed snow-covered volcanoes and
  magically beautiful surroundings, we decided &ndash; we were going there!&nbsp;Stay in tents and make ski trips near the
  volcanoes.&nbsp;The trip would be in the Do-It-Yourself&nbsp;spirit.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This meant that our journey started with a lot of preparations.&nbsp;The research was difficult - it ended with us
  translating Russian tourist sites using Google Translate.&nbsp;Applying for a visa on our own to Kamchatka is a whole
  other story in itself.</p>

  <p>We wake up in our tents and all the hard work with preparations for our journey into Kamchatka&#39;s wintery volcanic
  landscape is as if gone with the wind.&nbsp;This Russian March night has been cold down to minus thirty
  degrees&nbsp;Celsius.&nbsp;But sleeping was no problem.&nbsp;Double sleeping bags, full body underwear and cap solved
  that challenge.</p>

  <p>We start by fixing breakfast and realize that we have a couple of problems - the hard outer shell of the ski boot is
  frozen and rock hard, and our drinking water bottles are ice-filled.&nbsp;We&nbsp;grab the ski boots and
  the&nbsp;Nalgene&nbsp;bottles and place them near the lava river.&nbsp;The ski boots are warmed up and are soon warm
  enough to easily let the feet slip in and the contents of the bottles are made up of lava-melted water.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The volcano is constantly huffing and puffing behind us</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Then we do exactly what we came to do - go skiing.&nbsp;We set course for&nbsp;Tolbachik&#39;s&nbsp;regal
  peak.&nbsp;The snow&rsquo;s colors change from white to black.&nbsp;The newly formed ash creates marvelous
  patterns.&nbsp;We go easy on the skis so that we do not wear out our skins unnecessarily.&nbsp;Ashes are like
  fine-grained crushed glass and can wear our equipment out quickly.&nbsp;Unfortunately, low clouds drape over the volcano
  and we don&rsquo;t get very high up.&nbsp;We retreat and return when darkness approaches.&nbsp;There will be evening
  skiing with a colorful volcano eruption as a backdrop instead.&nbsp;Our search for Kamchatka&#39;s combination of wild
  nature, snow and fire-breathing mountains seem&nbsp;to have paid off.&nbsp;We go to bed in our tents and it is the
  beginning of hell in Kamchatka.</p>

  <p>During the night, a heavy wind comes in.&nbsp;Early in the morning, a cyclone strikes.&nbsp;The tent pins are broken
  and our igloo-shaped protection is no longer as igloo-shaped.&nbsp;We try to save what is left but give up
  and&nbsp;squeeze&nbsp;into each of the remaining two tents.&nbsp;Now we sleep closely with Sasha and his three clients
  and hear the wild Kamchatka wind roaring outside and like a machine gun pepper the tent cloth with volcanic gravel and
  sand.</p>

  <p>When we wake up the next day, the wind has settled.&nbsp;Tonight we&rsquo;re supposed to be picked up by the
  helicopter.&nbsp;Via satellite phone we find out that a new storm is coming in during the next night.&nbsp;The
  helicopter that is supposed to pick us up cannot lift.&nbsp;How do we handle another cyclone night in thirty degrees
  below zero?&nbsp;We decide to break up base camp and retreat to the&nbsp;Tolud&nbsp;cottage, which is located just over
  a mile further down the mountain.&nbsp;The cottage is used by Russian geologists who study the volcanoes nearby.</p>

  <p>When we come down to the&nbsp;Tolud&nbsp;cottage, we are grateful that we did not get lost in the icy wind that
  increased more and more.&nbsp;In the darkness of the cottage, four Russian geologists sit around a worn wooden table and
  welcome us.</p>

  <p><em>- Vodka?, </em>one of them asks.</p>

  <p>It warms us up nicely after the storm.&nbsp;But has a bitter aftertaste.&nbsp;It will be the start of a ten-day
  isolation in the cottage, sleeping on hard and cold wooden floors, dwindling food stores, card playing, despair and
  basic lessons in Russian.&nbsp;We can basically not leave the cottage to make any ski trips at all - the helicopter can
  come any day, and if we are not there then it leaves without us.</p>

  <p>The three nights planned will be fourteen at&nbsp;Tolbachik.&nbsp;At lunch on the last day of March 2013, a
  helicopter rotor is heard far away.&nbsp;Auditory hallucinations?&nbsp;But then it comes.&nbsp;Lands.&nbsp;We rush there
  and throw in all the stuff, the rotor is on.&nbsp;We sit&nbsp;in a&nbsp;large Russian transport helicopter of the type
  MI8 and behind us lay the volcano&nbsp;Tolbachik&nbsp;with its white&nbsp;steam plume.&nbsp;Under us, the alpine volcano
  landscape spreads out - enthrallingly beautiful and dangerous.</p>

  alpine traditions and integrating it with the surrounding nature.</p>

  <p>The ruins of an old farm building&nbsp;inspired the idea behind this project. The lot, on the slopes of the Orobic
  Alps, enjoys an outstanding view that you can experience from the large windows on the west front.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Stained glass windows contribute to the dialogue between the interior and the valley</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The structure itself is pretty simple:&nbsp;two stone walls connected by a reinforced concrete slab. Instead, the
  second floor, the roof and the facade are completely made of wood. The two baffles have been made of local stone&#39;s
  natural split, cleverly prepared. The facade, of brushed larch wood, is composed of a slats&#39; structure, referencing
  to the&nbsp;architecture&nbsp;of the alpine zone.</p>

  <p>It is just 22 square meters for each of the&nbsp;three floors: ground floor with kitchen area and
  fireplace;&nbsp;first floor with a bedroom and the&nbsp;bathroom&nbsp;and the upper floor with the master&#39;s
  bedroom.<br />
  The overall space is quite limited but this, linked to the materials&#39; choice, helped to create that
  hearty&rdquo;&nbsp;feeling and evocative power that was one of the cardinal principles of many rural architectures.</p>

  <p>A very light staircase&nbsp;with transparent landings connects the three levels and helps&nbsp;the full perception of
  the interior&#39;s height. For both the ground floor&nbsp;and the external paving we decided to use a
  luserna&rdquo;&nbsp;stone natural split,&nbsp;to emphasize the continuity between inside and outside.</p>

  <p>The whole set of style and materials choices&nbsp;have been dictated by the desire to reinterpret the
  tradition,&nbsp;for which both&nbsp;the client and the designer have a great, innate respect.&nbsp;</p>

We got to know the concept that the
  architects developed for this spot, owned by a German and South African couple.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <p>The design brief for the S&uacute;per Coffee and Food Store was straight and simple: to create a restaurant and
  kitchen where good and healthy food is produced and sold either as a take away or consumed on site within the retail
  space.&nbsp;The owners are an innovative couple. They are constantly exploring and developing their offer to provide
  their clients with a quality, healthy meal that includes coffee as well. Therefore they needed a design that allows
  flexibility.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The sun is always shining in this spot of Barcelona</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The kitchen space is clean and functional with white tiles and steel. In this environment the food is the
  protagonist. The retail area of S&uacute;per, where the food and coffee are sold, is a colorful space. The mustard
  yellow from the tinted concrete floor and the raw concrete bricks give the sensation that the sun is always shining in
  this spot of Barcelona.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>There are two eye-catching red-framed windows facing into a red space, which has changed from an experimental
  crop-growing laboratory to an extended office.&nbsp;The red windows can be either used as a seat or as a shelving unit.
  They provide the space with options and therefore flexibility and at the same time define a unique element in the
  S&uacute;per Coffee and Food Store.&nbsp;</p>

  their sportiest models, to become a separate brand. Enliven tested their first model Ateca in a sunny but windy
  Spain.</p>

  <p>Seat was founded in 1950 by a state-owned Spanish company.&nbsp;The first factory was in Barcelona and apart from the
  Spanish state and Spanish banks, Fiat was also a partner. Consequently, the first Seat models were based on Fiat 600,
  850 and 1400/1500.&nbsp;In 1986, Volkswagen bought Seat through its subsidiary Audi.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The journey Seat has made in the last ten years, perhaps even twenty, is completely in line with what
  Volkswagen&#39;s other brands have done.&nbsp;Almost all members of the Volkswagen Group have moved from cheap and
  simple brands to more expensive and more premium.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Skoda used to be the brand that got the most attention before Seat, but now the Spanish car company has all eyes
  on it</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>At the start, the sportiest models from the Seat had the addition Cupra&nbsp;in the name, such as Leon and Ibiza
  Cupra. Seat has great experience in racing and it is this department that has handled the&nbsp;Cupra
  versions.&nbsp;Although the step is large, it can be compared with the Audi RS, BMW M and Mercedes AMG.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Unlike these brands, they have now chosen to divide it up and make&nbsp;Cupra&nbsp;a separate brand and skip Seat on
  these models.&nbsp;Of course, this is still about Seat cars but in a very own vintage and with a sportier attribute than
  regular Seat models.&nbsp;First off among the&nbsp;Cupra models&nbsp;is the&nbsp;SUV&nbsp;Ateca, a
  model&nbsp;Enliven&nbsp;tested in Barcelona in 2016 when it was first introduced.</p>

  <p>The&nbsp;Ateca&nbsp;model&nbsp;is a compact SUV in the middle class.&nbsp;When&nbsp;Voyage&nbsp;tried it out in 2016,
  it stuck out thanks to equipment level, comfort and price.&nbsp;When it arrived, it was a very important piece of the
  puzzle for Seat to move its brand further and broaden the model program.&nbsp;What they are doing now by breaking up the
  brand into two and launching&nbsp;Cupra&nbsp;Ateca,&nbsp;is offering a model in a different segment where they are
  completely without competition.&nbsp;It&#39;s a sporty premium&nbsp;SUV with a price level that puts it far below other
  comparable cars, for example, the Audi RS Q3.</p>

  <p>The price of a&nbsp;Cupra&nbsp;Ateca&nbsp;starts at SEK 409,900 which is more than SEK 100,000 below the price the
  Audi RS Q3 had at launch in 2014. For that price, the performance is almost equal, Cupra&nbsp;Ateca&nbsp;has 300
  horsepower, which is 10 horses less than the Audi but does&nbsp;0-100&nbsp;kilometers per hour at the same time, 5.2
  seconds.&nbsp;To get the power down to all four wheels from that two-liter machine, a 7-speed DSG&nbsp;gearbox is
  used.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>A recipe that works both for </em><em>everyday</em><em> and for when you demand the little bit extra from the
  car</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The settings for being this versatile are Normal, Sport,&nbsp;Individual,&nbsp;Snow&nbsp;and Off-Road as well
  as&nbsp;Cupra.&nbsp;The switch for these selections is located between the seats behind the gear shift.&nbsp;The latter,
  which is advantageously chosen when you want to get the most out of the car&#39;s sportier character, changes the
  car&#39;s engine response, sound and also the adaptive dampers for more stable driving characteristics.</p>

  <p>In order not to mix up a&nbsp;Cupra&nbsp;Ateca&nbsp;with a regular Seat&nbsp;Ateca, a lot of effort has been put into
  the exterior.&nbsp;The grille in the front is beefy with large air intakes throughout the front.&nbsp;In the middle of
  the grille is the new Cupra emblem in bronze.&nbsp;At the bottom of the front and on an air intake is also the
  text&nbsp;Cupra&nbsp;so that no one should miss what this is all about.</p>

  <p>Unlike the usual Seat&nbsp;Ateca,&nbsp;Cupra Ateca is&nbsp;lowered and stands firmer on the ground thanks to
  this.&nbsp;At the rear, the car has four exhaust pipes at the bottom along with a&nbsp;diffuser&nbsp;that really
  provides a powerful and sporty tone.&nbsp;Here as well, you&rsquo;ll find a bronze-colored&nbsp;Cupra emblem&nbsp;but on
  top of a carbon fiber plate.&nbsp;At the&nbsp;top of the rear window&nbsp;there is a wing, whether it has any
  aerodynamic effect must be left unsaid but that it adds to the smoky look is something we can agree on.</p>

  <p>Inside, they have been generous with&nbsp;Alcantara,&nbsp;which most people can agree is a nice material.&nbsp;The
  seams on the steering wheel and the chairs are bronze-colored just like the emblems that the steering wheel is adorned
  with as well.&nbsp;Instead of traditional analog meters,&nbsp;a large display&nbsp;fills the space in front of the
  steering wheel.&nbsp;Here you get all the motor data as well as navigation, more neatly and easily overviewed.&nbsp;The
  infotainment system&nbsp;is, of course, compatible with Apple CarPlay and the corresponding for Android phones.</p>

  <p>The test run from Barcelona Airport offers highway mostly and you can speed up quite a lot and barely notice it. The
  fine asphalt that roads are provided with here makes the tire noise minimal and hardly heard in the car despite the
  large rims.&nbsp;One has to throw an extra eye on the speedometer from time to time in order not to be too far above the
  speed limit.&nbsp;The nice&nbsp;thing about an over-motorized car&nbsp;is that when you go for a calm and quiet ride in
  harmony, the engine does not have to work too hard but without feeling weak.&nbsp;This also leads to lower consumption
  in the long run.</p>

  <p>To really feel what&nbsp;Cupra&nbsp;Ateca&nbsp;is all about, they have arranged a closed-down route on a public
  highway.&nbsp;Along the route, officials are sent to see that nothing happens but not to cause you to slow down. This
  particular type of driving I personally consider to be among the most enjoyable available. Hitting the pedal to the
  metal on an unknown road without being worried about oncoming traffic, a bit like driving
  at&nbsp;N&uuml;rburgring&nbsp;or rally for those who have had the pleasure of experiencing that.&nbsp;After a round, the
  adrenaline is pumping and the&nbsp;Brembo&nbsp;brakes are next to red hot but&nbsp;Cupra&nbsp;Ateca&nbsp;is absolutely
  not tired or exhausted and is happy to take another round.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>What they have succeeded with by dividing the company into two divisions is that they have increased its image as a
  brand with performance and premium feel in the genes.&nbsp;Something one might not initially think of if someone
  mentioned the name Seat.&nbsp;But&nbsp;with Cupra&nbsp;Ateca&nbsp;they manage this really well and the model really
  gives off that feeling of sportiness needed if you are to find just the right customers who want more than just a
  Seat.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The project is based on two specific conditions: on one side the client&rsquo;s needs, looking for a small and
  intimate space;&nbsp;on the other hand&nbsp;a small, special and precious place.&nbsp;The alpine landscape dominates the
  place:&nbsp;it becomes evident the condition of a privileged and unique space.</p>

  <p>The concept of size guides the project.&nbsp;Great is the land, the&nbsp;landscape;&nbsp;small is&nbsp;the place,
  the&nbsp;space. There is a mutual relationship that inspires the design process.&nbsp;What is the role of the
  room&nbsp;in relation to the landscape? How the landscape reflects, &ldquo;adopts&rdquo;&nbsp;this room?&nbsp;The point
  of&nbsp;view changes in a frenzied search for balance.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>A micro retreat for weekends</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A&nbsp;place for contemplation,&nbsp;a&nbsp;clearinghouse from the&nbsp;daily hectic urban condition.&nbsp;A small
  wooden box fits between two existing buildings. Inside, the wood shows its nature in warm tones;&nbsp;outside, &nbsp;the
  surface treatment&nbsp;with silver-gray paint&nbsp;echoes the colors of the centenarian&nbsp;woods of alpine&nbsp;rural
  buildings.&nbsp;The wooden panels,&nbsp;assembled with different development of the vein (horizontal -
  vertical),&nbsp;react to sunlight returning different geometric compositions.</p>

  <p>Outside, almost in a mimetic condition,&nbsp;the new wooden facade seems to hide itself&nbsp;in the shadows of the
  landscape,&nbsp;and then to&nbsp;confirm,&nbsp;with sunlight,&nbsp;its presence, dazzling,&nbsp;throwing a visible
  signal at a&nbsp;long distance. Inside,&nbsp;the space becomes a privileged place overlooking the&nbsp;landscape. Almost
  an&nbsp;abstraction,&nbsp;an estrangement that allows emphasizing the privileged status of the &ldquo;spectator&rdquo;.
  A second level of thinking regards the stability of the building&rsquo;s image&nbsp;in the landscape: spaces
  lived&nbsp;for short periods consolidate their status of&nbsp;&ldquo;closed&rdquo;&nbsp;places.</p>

  <p>The light that reflects differently on the&nbsp;wooden panels changes&nbsp;the appearance in&nbsp;sand color tones,
  the uninhabited fa&ccedil;ade lives of its own life.&nbsp;Finally, the project&nbsp;underlines yet another ambiguity: as
  a&nbsp;wooden container, like furniture and&nbsp;furnishing, it&nbsp;is &ldquo;a wardrobe&nbsp;in the
  landscape&rdquo;.</p>

Greece, right?</p>

  <p>Imagine a scene from Peter Jackson&#39;s King Kong, minus all the crazy animals. After a few days in the charming
  Parga we have made our way to the village of Monodendri and then run, down, down, down into the Vikos Gorge. The
  world&#39;s deepest ravine, at least in proportion to its width.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>We are completely surrounded by vegetation, it&#39;s amazingly green and&nbsp;beautiful</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We are here to run the trail, that most of the others here are walking. On this day we are as good as alone in the
  whole valley. The path offers stone-paved stairs and paths, dirt paths and cliffs. The terrain is varied, first stone
  and steep cliffs in all directions and then magical moss-covered forests, fresh herbs, and traces of wild boar hunting
  for truffles. Simply perfect for a trail adventure. When we run, we are continuously in awe; we cannot believe that we
  are in Greece.</p>

  <p>We are in the Pindus Mountains, near the border to Albania and when we get out of the ravine to the other side of the
  village of Vikos, we see it in its full splendor, a stupendously magical and very dramatic valley. The ravine itself is
  about twenty kilometers long. At its deepest, it is 1600m, and only a few meters wide in its most narrow places.</p>

  <p>We spend the night at Bourazani Wildlife Resort, which is as far from packaged charter trips as you could imagine.
  Unique is just one word for it, and the man who runs it brings to mind a Greek version of Basil Fawlty, but in a good
  way.</p>

  <p>If the day before we started was downwards, then day two outside the village of Konista we start running upwards.
  Straight up, straight into the woods, almost undiscovered, but of course, there is a small path there, it even has a
  name, &ldquo;the Kerasia path&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>Our guide Costas Nikolopoulos knows at least&nbsp;where we are going. Soon we will leave the forest and end up on a
  mountain ridge. It will be a long day on the ridge, running for some parts, sometimes we have to settle for walking.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>This day offers views we didn&#39;t think we would find in Greece</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is both green and very hilly, but we suck it up and continue to stick in there. We make a loop up via Ntavalista
  and down to the completely empty and silent monastery in Stomio.</p>

  <p>Except for nights in the Greek countryside, the base of our trail adventure has been the small village of Parga. With
  the risk of sounding like a tourist brochure, Parga is very cozy and almost idyllic. The village is spread out in the
  shape of a horseshoe with a nice and quiet cove.</p>

  <p>The harbor promenade is littered with, what you usually find in Greece, relatively cozy restaurants where it may be a
  little bit difficulty in spotting the difference between one and the other. But it is still very cozy. As the finale
  of&nbsp;this&nbsp;journey, some in our gang round off the weekend running the duathlon competition Agelos Fetsis Parga.
  But if you are on a training weekend, why not.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/outdoor/different-greece-trail-running-pindus-mountains</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/outdoor/different-greece-trail-running-pindus-mountains</guid><category><![CDATA[Outdoor]]></category><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 08:05:47 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Daniel Breece</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grand Basel]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>This year, a brand new car show, Grand Basel, opened up its gates for the first time. James Holm was present at the

  the glacier-swept mountains offering top-notch skiing.</p>

  <p><em>Check this out, a peanut in my glove!, </em>says &Oslash;yvind Gjersvik.&nbsp;He shakes the misplaced nut out
  from his ski glove and puts it in his mouth. We laugh. <em>Perfect since we were going to make a short meal break
  anyway, before the last bit up to Ronsfjellet&rdquo;,</em> says &Oslash;yvind.</p>

  <p>We some drink water and have some snacks from our backpacks. &Oslash;yvind who guides us is raised here in the area
  and knows the mountains like his back pocket. His main occupation is as an industrial climber on an oil rig in the North
  Sea and therefore he has many days off per year. He also has time to run guide operations through his company
  &ldquo;Mel&oslash;y Adventure&rdquo;&nbsp;and thus gets between fifty and eighty ski days a year.</p>

  <p>We are in Mel&oslash;y municipality on the southern side of Glomfjorden. There are only a few hundred vertical meters
  left to the top of Ronsfjellet. We try to take in the view towards Bj&aelig;rangfjorden and beyond towards the sea. The
  east wall at Kjeldalstinden looks mighty big and steep from our position on the slopes of Ronsfj&auml;llet.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The peaks around us extend up to, and just above, 1,000 meters high. Several of them can be skied all the way
  down to the salty and cold sea water in the fjord</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>From the very community of Glomfjord &mdash;it is both a fjord and a village with just over a thousand
  inhabitants&mdash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s an hour drive to Ytre Kjeldal where we parked our rental car and started this ski
  trip.</p>

  <p>But the distance as the bird flies from here to Glomfjord is not that far. However, the car journey went, among other
  things, through the nearly eight-kilometer-long tunnel that goes under the big glacier Svartisen, and then road 17
  snaked along Nordfjorden, and then to road 452 along Bj&aelig;rangfjorden.</p>

  <p>Finally, we came to the small collection of houses and farms that are Ytre Kjeldal. And while we&rsquo;re on the
  subject of driving - Glomfjord is two hours&rsquo; drive south of the larger town of Bod&oslash;.</p>

  <p>- <em>Time to ski now, stop staring at nature</em>, says &Oslash;yvind Gjersvik.</p>

  <p>We have reached the top of Ronsfjellet. Downhill is a good north-west slope where a somewhat annoying crust layer
  makes the experience 96 % from perfect. Then over to the next section north-east down to Reindalen which is a
  wonderfully large bowl where we ski down towards the actual Reindalselva, a run of a total of just over seven hundred
  vertical meters.</p>

  <p>&Oslash;yvind takes us further up to the next run. We have to climb and walk the steep way up from the frozen lake,
  which is troublesome in the less than perfect&nbsp;snow conditions. But when we get over the crest and glimpse
  Reindalstinden on the other side, we let our pulse come down and put on the ski skins.</p>

  <p>The daylight vanes bit by bit and darkness spreads over the mountains here in northern Norway. This far north, early
  February days are very short.</p>

  <p>Before we put on the headlamps to walk the last bit up, we look north towards the dark waters of Glomfjorden. On the
  other side, the small communities from Reip&aring; in the west via &Oslash;rnes to Glomfjord in the east light up. Above
  Glomfjord, we also see the slopes of the small ski resort curling down like small white snakes through the dark
  forest.</p>

  <p>The ski resort above the village of Glomfjord is about as far from Norway&#39;s largest ski resort Trysil as you can
  get. A simple facility with two lifts operated on a non-profit basis. The moon has found its way over Glomfjorden and
  the light reflects in the waters, but the beautiful northern lights that can sometimes be seen at these latitudes
  don&rsquo;t seem to want to come forward and treat us to their shimmering green sky dance.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Even during the Second World War, people sat up in the mountains, scouting, under cover of darkness</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In September 1942, &ldquo;Operation Musketoon&rdquo;&nbsp;began when twelve commanders from England, Canada and
  Norway were set ashore by the French submarine Junon in Bj&aelig;rangfjorden, i.e. the same fjord where our car is
  parked. At that time, this was serious - Norway was occupied by Nazi-controlled Germany and fought for its freedom.</p>

  <p>There was no question of going country skiing in the mountains to enjoy skiing and romantic nature views. The aim of
  the operation was to sabotage the Glomfjord power plant, which produced lots of energy from the glacier Svartisen&#39;s
  meltwater. The twelve young men made their way over the mountain and sabotaged the turbine hall and piping. After the
  campaign, the occupants gave up the planned expansion of the aluminum plant in Glomfjord. Four of the twelve soldiers
  passed over to Sweden to the east, one of them died from a bayonet-slash from a German soldier and the other seven were
  captured alive, but were put in the concentration camp Sachsenhausen and in October of the same year executed with shots
  to the neck.</p>

  <p>We ski down to the fjord in the light of our headlamps. The snow is a bit poor at the bottom, but it is a fun and
  quite a risk-free ski adventure. With his usual skill and experience, &Oslash;yvind shows us the way down. He has also
  arranged a RIB from his guide company to picks us down by a pier. We cross the black fjord water, and glide through the
  thin ice sheets that lie here and there, floating on the surface.</p>

  <p>-<em> I have cooked halibut for you, welcome inside where it&rsquo;s warm!</em></p>

  <p>The welcoming committee on the bridge is Swedish Hel&eacute;n, who originally comes from Eksj&ouml; in Sm&aring;land,
  and her magnificent dog Taiga who is an Alaska Husky. When we step inside, it turns out to be an old fishing shed -
  ancient life jackets hanging on the walls, fishing gear with buoys and nets from the ceiling. In one corner a
  wood-burning stove, in the other, a bar. The fishing company H.J Kristensen &amp;
  S&oslash;nner&#39;s&rdquo;&nbsp;repaired fishing nets in this cottage as early as 1930.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>We eat halibut that Helena&#39;s husband Fred Inge caught locally in the fjord, a fish of 35 kilos</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;Irish coffee, anyone?&rdquo;&nbsp;Hel&eacute;n asks. Served with the white, tasty fish there is
  some&nbsp;garlic sauce and oven-roasted root vegetables, as well as a salad with fresh pomegranate dressing. Helena
  tells us that she met her husband, who is from Bod&oslash;, in Qatar. She worked as a lawyer, he as an engineer with
  Norwegian Hydro. They wanted to try something new and moved together to Vassdalsvik to try a new life. Hel&eacute;n
  loves life in Vassdalsvik:</p>

  <p>- From our large pier we can look out over the fjord, sit under warm duvets and drink hot chocolate or a glass of
  wine. If we&rsquo;re lucky we can see the Northern Lights when it gets dark. In the fjord water anything from dolphins,
  toothed whales and otters can appear, in the sky we sometimes see white-tailed eagles. This is a magical place for
  us!</p>

  <p>It has been a long day of skiing: twelve hours plus; it is with quiet tongues and heavy eyelids that we stumble into
  Mel&oslash;y Overnattning, after the feast at Helena&rsquo;s and the hour-long car ride home (&Oslash;yvind&#39;s father
  assisted in case you wonder how that worked, logistically).</p>

  <p>The next day starts with a late, extended breakfast with coffee that gets up to three or four refills before we take
  a look at the mountain map and plan the trip up towards Istinden which &Oslash;yvind promises to be &ldquo;easy and with
  a wonderfully beautiful view of Lofoten&#39;s pointy mountains&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>We start the actual summit trip towards Istinden, which lies above Glomfjord&#39;s ski center, at an easy pace to say
  the least. The ski resort is located at 141 meters above sea level. The slopes are empty and snowy, the recent weeks
  have taken a hard toll on the snow, from rain among other things. Neither of the two lifts is running this weekday and
  therefore we march upwards in the piste right of the large cliff Glomvassh&aring;gen that separates the T-bar and chair
  lift.</p>

  <p>We reach &Oslash;vre Glomvattnet and move further on&nbsp;up the mountain. The top of the glacier Glombreen is bulky
  and relatively flat, making it hard to orientate as a newcomer. We have Istinden with its 1,194 meters high as a
  benchmark because it is located at the far end and another easily recognizable peak is the Sphinx which is a pointy and
  snow-free mountain ridge that protrudes basically straight west from the chair lift&#39;s mountain station, above the
  Sphinx is also the slightly rounded top of Tverrfjellet, which is close to the 1,000 meter mark.</p>

  <p>As we approach the actual Istinden, I see two large and floating creatures in the pass between Istinden and its
  neighbor Lille Istinden. To the north, on the other side of the pass, the mountain drops steeply and mercilessly down.
  The white-tailed eagle couple doesn&rsquo;t&rsquo; stay for long - they won&rsquo;t find any food on the mountain
  today.</p>

  <p>From the top of Istinden, the view is one of that beautiful Norwegian fjord and sea-views you can only get in this
  country. The soft light this early in the season in February also adds something to the experience. We see the fjords,
  the sea far away in the northwest and the mighty wall of Lofoten. When the sun begins to give way, the moon takes over -
  just like yesterday at Reindalstind. We remove our ski skins and put the tech bindings in ski mode and push out
  downwards. It&rsquo;s four hundred super nice vertical meters of unforgettable cruising and we aim for Tverrfjellet.
  After a couple of high fives, it is time to go upwards a bit again. Up towards Tverrfjellet is a short trip with the ski
  skins.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>It was right here at Tverrfjellet that the Norwegian super film company Field Productions shot some of the scenes
  to</em><em>&lsquo;Supervention 2&rsquo;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Jesper Tj&auml;der was one of those who showed their aerial knowledge on the great jump that was built and then
  beautifully filmed with Glomfjorden in the background. In addition, the film is perhaps best known for Tj&auml;der&#39;s
  loop rail which was filmed on Juvass&#39;s summer ski resort. &Oslash;yvind Gjersvik, our friendly guide conscious
  Glomfjord ambassador had a finger in the pot, he says:</p>

  <p>- The whole gang from Field stayed with me at Mel&oslash;y Overnattning when they came here. I had been saying to
  Filip Christensen, Field&#39;s founder, for five years that they had to come to Glomfjord and film. He had shown
  lukewarm amounts of interest, but then they suddenly came! Everyone was very happy with the result!</p>

  <p>When on top of Tverrfjellet, the sun is gone, but the moonlight and our headlamps allow us to evening ski all the way
  down to the seat lift&#39;s top station and further down to the valley station. We call &Oslash;yvind and tell him about
  our wonderful ski day. A day where we haven&#39;t seen any other skiers:</p>

  <p>- You could stay a whole winter here skiing without ever seeing any traces of other skiers.</p>

  <p>He may be both a local patriot and a high-level seller, but we are prepared to believe him. The number of skiable
  peaks around Glomfjord and Bod&oslash; is so large that the possibilities are enormous, the possibilities of variation
  endless. But it is time to leave the small Glomfjord for a valley as lonely as grand. Tomorrow we&#39;ll head for
  Beiarn. Our ski adventure around Bod&oslash; has only just begun.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/skiing/summit-trip-bodo-norway</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/skiing/summit-trip-bodo-norway</guid><category><![CDATA[Skiing]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2019 16:39:33 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Fredrik Schenholm, Anders Wingqvist</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Restaurant Ernst — The Most Interesting Restaurant in Berlin]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Restaurant Ernst is currently one of the world's “gotta be there” places. Food lovers from all over arrive at this 
  small restaurant in Berlin. The man behind it is Dylan Watson-Brawn, who is creating a symphony of enjoyable flavors 
  with fresh foods and creativity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fresh cheese from David, our farmer who delivered all dairy products for tonight&#39;s dinner. He has a
  special breed of cows that gives milk with a high fat percentage, and each cow provides about six liters of milk per
  day. The cheese is served with rennet and wild chervil&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>The first appetizer is presented at the restaurant Ernst in Berlin, and then some radishes, which were pulled out of
  the soil in the morning, are sprinkled with cherry blossom salt and served with umeboshi pasta. Followed by a rich
  variety of potatoes, which are grown on an island without electricity.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>There are several reasons why foodies from all over the world travel to Berlin to visit Ernst</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We have seen season- and location-driven restaurants before, as well as those inspired by Japan, but don&rsquo;t let
  that stop you from reading. The approach and the team who lead the process are absolutely crucial. The man behind the
  restaurant is called Dylan Watson-Brawn, and he could easily be on the top of any list over the world&#39;s most
  talented chefs. Ernst was recently named number 62 on the OAD European Top 100+ list and was thus the highest ranked
  newcomer of the year after having been open only for eight months.</p>

  <p>Dylan Watson-Brawn grew up in Vancouver with two parents who always urged him to pursue his interests.</p>

  <p><em>- I remember that we had a &ldquo;bring your kid to work day&rdquo; at school, where one would accompany one of
  their parents to work. My dad was a dentist, and we both agreed that it was a boring job,</em>says Dylan when we meet at
  Ernst.</p>

  <p>It&#39;s morning in Berlin, and motor noise from the excavator on the street comes in through the open window. The
  restaurant is completely unspoiled on the ground floor of a multi-family house in one of the less-favored areas of
  Berlin.</p>

  <p><em>- Previously the building was a casino. It&#39;s close to home, and the size of the room fit perfectly,</em> says
  Dylan about the choice of location.</p>

  <p>The restaurant consists of a large, simply equipped kitchen with a bar counter for twelve guests. The decor is sparse
  and the atmosphere intimate, just as Dylan wants it. Ernst&#39;s origin is a homeplace that he and his friend Spencer
  started three years ago.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>There was not a single restaurant in Berlin where I wanted to work, so we started our own</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We return to Dylan, his family and his teen days. The reason for the double-name Watson-Brawn is simple: one is his
  father&#39;s, the other his mother&#39;s - the two people who are closest to him.</p>

  <p><em>- Mom didn&#39;t want to take dad&#39;s surname. She has always worked and been independent, </em>says Dylan.
  <em>My parents are people who tried to live a family life and realized that it didn&#39;t make them happy. In the end,
  they came to the conclusion that it was better to stop caring so much about what others think, and that made them
  successful. I grew up in a home where we lived by small means, but today my parents are well- off. But they do not
  support me financially. It is important that I stand on my own feet.</em></p>

  <p>Dylan ended up in a restaurant in Vancouver. A finer Belgian tavern with ambition. There he quickly found his call
  and started working more hours when he was fourteen. At the age of sixteen he traveled with dad on vacation to Japan.
  The idea was to find inspiration and then go to a restaurant school in Canada. But fate would be different. During a
  visit to Nihonruori Ryugin, a three-star kaiseki restaurant led by Seiji Yamamoto, Dylan was taken over. A Japanese
  friend helped him to apply for an internship, and a few weeks later an e-mail came.</p>

  <p><em>- It said I could start on Monday. I started </em><em>at</em><em> the counter, where all the porcelain would be
  washed by hand. Although I just stood there I learned a lot about cooking. They were the toughest months of my life.
  Every day I wanted to go home and cry. They were hard&nbsp;and long working days, but I grew into it, and after five
  months they asked if I wanted to stay.</em></p>

  <p>Due to rules on work permits and a major earthquake in Tokyo, Dylan decided instead to practice at Eleven Madison
  Park in New York. He later returned to Ryugin in Tokyo and was also in the opening of Ryugin in Hong Kong. After a short
  internship at Noma, he settled in Berlin &mdash;&nbsp;nineteen years old. He wanted to stay near his German friends, but
  finding a job proved to be difficult.</p>

  <p><em>- I found no restaurant that I liked, and I was really disappointed. I came from Noma, where food has a strong
  sense of time and place. I do not strive for a Scandinavian perspective with fresh goods from the local area, but I need
  to know an identity, that there is a deeply rooted thought process. I want the restaurateur to have a vision and stand
  by it. I love restaurants like Noma, L&rsquo;Ambroisie </em><em>and</em><em> L&rsquo;Arp&egrave;ge.</em></p>

  <p>For Dylan, not only the food but the entire restaurant experience is important. &ldquo;Taste is personal, and it
  doesn&#39;t matter what we put on the plate if you don&#39;t feel comfortable in the dining room&rdquo;, he says.</p>

  <p>Dylan is stubborn and determined by the way he wants to work. That is why his first real workplace in Berlin was his
  own restaurant, J&uuml;ng, Gr&uuml;n &amp;&nbsp;Blau, a restaurant for six people where he and his friend Spencer could
  develop. As more and more guests found it, the place became one of the most difficult to book in Berlin.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Europe is really a small area, and&nbsp;here is such a variety of ingredients</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The phone rings, Dylan responds and Spencer goes off to pick up vegetables. The preparations for tonight&#39;s dinner
  are in full swing. The restaurant&#39;s suppliers are carefully selected. During the three years he has been driving in
  Berlin, he has carefully searched for producers as driven and devoted as himself.</p>

  <p><em>- Branca, one of our largest gardeners, washes all ingredients in water from its well. She cares incredibly much
  about her vegetables and how they are taken care of,</em> he says. <em>We want to work with the highest form of
  agriculture, which I believe is biodynamic. If you do well and spend time and care, it will be better. Those who work
  biodynamically care about the earth and the environment. I usually lean on research, but in
  </em><em>biodynamics</em><em> there is an important relationship between farm, animals, crops and the natural flora and
  fauna.</em></p>

  <p>During a dinner at Ernst, it is also clear how great the importance of the earth is.</p>

  <p><em>- Yes, indeed. It&#39;s like wine. Grapes are grown in different soils, and so the taste varies. The same applies
  to vegetables; see for example the asparagus. We have chosen a farm that is close to a river where a lot of water flows
  into the soil. They never need watering and are the only biodynamic growers in Germany. I don&rsquo;t do this to tell a
  good story, but because of the quality. The context is important and makes a difference.</em></p>

  <p>The menu at Ernst changes depending on which fresh goods are available, which in itself depends on season and
  climate, but also on the supplier&#39;s schedule. Most food come from the local area, but for example, the charcuteries
  are taken from a farm in Austria where the farmer Christoph Weisner breeds mangalitza pigs, while the citrus fruits come
  from Sicily, where Dylan works closely with a smaller producer.</p>

  <p><em>- I am not dogmatic with the country the ingredients come from, </em>he says. <em>For some reason, we have
  created national borders. I&#39;m from Vancouver, and it takes me five hours to fly to the middle of Canada. I can fly
  to Sicily in an hour and a half.</em><em>If I find great people to work with, why not? It is about quality and
  philosophy.</em></p>

  <p>Dylan also tells about the pig farm in Austria.</p>

  <p><em>- They&#39;re amazing. They make the best meat I&#39;ve ever eaten, so why wouldn&#39;t I support them? We can do
  a lot by ourselves at the restaurant, but I will never be able to make as good </em><em>chark as</em><em> Christoph. We
  want to pay tribute to him and serve his meat to our guests. I learned this from Yamamoto San. We talked about miso. He
  doesn&rsquo;t do his own, he buys it from a dedicated family who has done miso for hundreds of years. A product
  doesn&#39;t have to be good just because you do it yourself. With </em><em>money</em><em> you can buy caviar and
  truffles, but it is super boring. For me, it&#39;s about what you can&#39;t buy. It doesn&#39;t matter how much you pay
  the supplier; if you do not have the same philosophy and</em><em>ideals</em><em>, they do not want to deliver to you.
  It&#39;s interesting.</em></p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/restaurant-ernst-most-interesting-restaurant-berlin</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/restaurant-ernst-most-interesting-restaurant-berlin</guid><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2019 08:00:50 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Tove Oskarsson Henckel</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[BMW i8 Roadster — The Sports Car of the Future, Now as a Convertible]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>When the i8 was shown as a concept it was roofless, but when production started it had one. Now, four years after the
  launch, a new roadster version will be made available.</p>

  <p>The electrified division of BMW has the addition of the letter &ldquo;i&rdquo;: BMWi. The first two models, and so
  far the only ones on the market, are the i3 and i8. The former a practical compact city car, available either as a
  hybrid or fully electric. i8, being a sports car, is on the other hand only available as a hybrid. In 2009, the
  i8&nbsp;concept was shown at the Frankfurt&#39;s car saloon, but already a year earlier, a BMW M1 study, with the name
  &ldquo;Hommage Concept&rdquo;, was shown. This laid&nbsp;the foundation to which later became the new i8 concept.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The aerodynamic design of the car makes you almost lose yourself when you look at it</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The first production car rolled out of the factory in 2014. With the exception that it had a roof. There were minimal
  changes to the concept. The appearance of the i8 really stands out from everything else, there are so many aerodynamic
  shapes on the car that you can lose yourself when you look at it. No one will stay indifferent if you roll by in an i8,
  even less when you park it and open the frameless scissor-doors. Even on a roadster is a true<br />
  delight to the eye.</p>

  <p>Design wise you will definitely not be disappointed: i8 is based on an F1-like construction, with a carbon fiber and
  plastic monocoque. The i8 roadster powertrain - a 143-horsepower electric motor combined with a 1.5 liter three-cylinder
  petrol engine, with 275 horsepower. Combined, the electricity and gasoline engine generates 374 horsepower.</p>

  <p>Apart from the facelift, adding a roadster version, capacity to the the lithium-ion battery was added, 70 percent to
  be exact, which gives 12 horsepowers more than before. The range for electric drive is now 53 kilometers, which is 16
  kilometers more than before, when you had 37 kilometers in pure electric drive. The sprints from stationary to one
  hundred are completed in 4.6 seconds thanks to both engines working simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The great thing about i8 Roadster performance must still be the consumption. Despite a relatively active driving
  without having to think too much about keeping down petrol consumption, you still land at just over two liters/10 km,
  which is crazy for such a fun sports car.</p>

  <p>The BMW i8 Roadster can run in different programs; you can either run it completely on the electric &ldquo;EV
  mode&rdquo;, but only for 53 kilometers as previously mentioned, and at a maximum speed of 120 kilometers per hour. Then
  the car has a Comfort and EcoPro mode. There is also a Sports mode available, if you slide the gear selector to the
  left. This changes the character of the car significantly and the meter charts change color from white to red. The
  engine noise also wakes up to life with a lovely growl.</p>

  <p>And it sounds great! All engine sounds are digitally-amplified that comes from the car&#39;s speakers. From the
  outside, the car doesn&rsquo;t make much noise, even though you hear the petrol engine. The great thing about cars like
  the i8 Roadster is that you easily can switch to fully electric drive and glide through town completely silent.<br />
  When it comes to active driving with the i8 Roadster, it&rsquo;s really fun, the progressive steering is speed adapted
  and at lower speeds is easily controlled, while in higher speeds it becomes heavier and small steering wheel movements
  are barely noticeable.</p>

  <p>Although the car is almost two meters wide, it handles incredibly nimble in tight corners, and completely undramatic
  in high speeds. BMW has succeeded with something really unique, with the i8 Roadster and the fact that they have chosen
  to launch a car like this now is exactly what was needed to turn up the temperature in the EV space. Since the
  technology exists, we would like to see more cars like this and if only the price was a bit easier to digest, more
  people would have chosen to drive an i8 Roadster!</p>

  <p>What do you do when you run out of room in your small city house to display your growing collection of vintage items?
  This is what happened to Daniel&nbsp;Burgermeister and Glenny Eastwood, and they solved the problem by buying an old run
  down 1860 miners cottage in Chewton, central Victoria, and restoring and extending it to create more space for their
  various collections. Daniel has done most of the renovation and extended the house himself.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The house had been lived in since the 1950s by a lady in her 90s, and when they bought the property the garden was
  overgrown with blackberries and gorse, and needed lots of work. It took the couple some years to get the garden under
  control. There was no bathroom and they had to shower outside for years before Daniel built the bathroom. The house
  shows Daniel&#39;s skills as a builder and renovator and he will go to extreme lengths to get the details of the
  building right.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Antique building materials are sourced from flea markets, junk shops and on eBay</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It&#39;s hard to tell now what has been added and what was part of the original building. Recycled building materials
  help give the atmosphere of age to the cottage, and all the work the couple has done is very sympathetic&nbsp;to the old
  cottage.</p>

  <p>Over the years their collections of painted furniture, flea market paintings, antique fabrics and textiles, vintage
  toys, china, and kitchenalia have expanded and filled the cottage. The couple travels frequently and always manage to
  visit markets and antique dealers while overseas and bring home a few treasures.</p>

  <p>Like a lot of home renovators, Daniel and Glenny&nbsp;&ldquo;have got the bug&rdquo;, it has become a way of life
  hunting down building materials and Daniel has also renovated outbuildings and sheds on the property and built a barn to
  house guests.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/home-garden-design-decor/antiques-cottage-chewton-australia</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/home-garden-design-decor/antiques-cottage-chewton-australia</guid><category><![CDATA[Antiques & Auctions]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 10:27:24 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Simon Griffiths</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adelaide, a Relatively Unknown Little Gem]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Adelaide may not be the first city that comes to mind when thinking of a trip to Australia, but if you are interested
  in food and drink, it is well worth a visit.</p>

  <p>Taking a plane to Adelaide from Sydney takes a little longer than Arlanda - Kastrup and is well worth a trip.&nbsp;My
  first stop is&nbsp;Penfold&#39;s&nbsp;Magill&nbsp;Estate; one of the oldest of their vineyards and also the smallest,
  but it has two restaurants that serve fantastic food daily.</p>

  <p>The more humble&nbsp;Magill&nbsp;Estate&nbsp;Kitchen, where the food is rural and rustic, a fantastic chicken liver
  pate is a great start and their own made gnocchi with&nbsp;taleggio cheese&nbsp;and pears a fantastic
  continuation.&nbsp;All of course made to pair well with their countless wines on the glass.</p>

  <p>Their other restaurant,&nbsp;Magill&nbsp;Estate&nbsp;Restaurant, focuses more on fine&nbsp;dining and in the kitchen
  we find Scott Huggins&nbsp;cooking great food.&nbsp;Scott has long experience of many top restaurants around the world
  such as&nbsp;Iggy&#39;s and&nbsp;Tippling&nbsp;club
  in&nbsp;Singapore&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ryugin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Narisawa&nbsp;in&nbsp;Tokyo.&nbsp;The meal
  at&nbsp;Magill&nbsp;Estate&nbsp;Restaurant will be most memorable when it includes a piece of local wagyu along with
  a&nbsp;Penfold&rsquo;s&nbsp;Grange&nbsp;from 1977. The food is incredibly well-prepared and most of the raw materials
  are grown locally.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The restaurants are open to the public and sitting in the middle of the vineyard and eating is a fantastic
  experience</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>That Scott might be one of the most pleasant and welcoming chefs you will ever meet does not make the experience
  worse. To continue on the wine route, a visit to the small vineyard Unico&nbsp;Zelo is&nbsp;well worth the short journey
  up into the Adelaide Hills, and to&nbsp;Gumeracha, not only because nature is incredibly beautiful here but the wines
  and spirits that Brendan and Laura Carter make are innovative and consistently very good.</p>

  <p>If you love gin then the one they make themselves at Applewood distillery is well worth taking home with you;
  however, my favorite is their Okar which is a version of&nbsp;Aperol&nbsp;made on native herbs and berries.&nbsp;Brendan
  and his wife specialize in Italian wine&nbsp;varieties such as Fiano, Nebbiolo and Dolcetto.</p>

  <p>Back to the food, don&#39;t miss these most talked-about restaurants in Adelaide!</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong><em>Clever&nbsp;Little&nbsp;Tailor</em></strong></p>

  <p>With&nbsp;their cocktails&nbsp;and an impressive wine list with wines from the Adelaide Hills and other exciting
  parts of Australia, the bar impresses greatly, the drinks are well thought out and the atmosphere is the good kind of
  busy but lovely.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong><em>Orana</em></strong></p>

  <p>Orana is&nbsp;run by Jock&nbsp;Zonfrillo, a chef who has a long relationship with Australia even though he is from
  Scotland. The restaurant is on the second floor and you have to know that it is there to&nbsp;realize that the small
  staircase leads up to the restaurant itself, the sign is almost invisible.&nbsp;Once inside the restaurant, there are
  light colors on the wall that dominate together with wooden details and delicious murals.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The&nbsp;Orana Foundation has created an almost magical contact with the aborigines</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This relationship stretches from utilizing their knowledge of the native raw materials, to create an organization
  where they can benefit from these skills economically as well. The dinner was nothing if not inspiring and Jock&#39;s
  passion catches on and after a conversation with him you understand that he is passionate about what he does.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong><em>Peel&nbsp;Street</em></strong></p>

  <p>On a small street in the middle of&nbsp;Adelaide, there is a myriad of bars and restaurants, including Peel Street,
  perhaps my most appealing visit to a restaurant for a long time. Sitting in the bar you get your money&rsquo;s worth,
  with a kitchen dominated by love for things that are a bit more robust and very generous portions. The chefs Jordan
  Theodoros and Martin&nbsp;Corcoran&nbsp;have long and solid experience and it feels a bit like you are at home with your
  friend&#39;s mother who just wants to feed you as much as she can.</p>

  <p>Their wine list reflects much of what Australia stands for today, young winemakers and natural wines, but also more
  traditional.&nbsp;I can&#39;t get enough of my salad with crispy pork and chili and the toasted bread with various
  fixings.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/adelaide-relatively-unknown-little-gem</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/adelaide-relatively-unknown-little-gem</guid><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 09:00:37 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Simon Bajada, Daniella Illerbrand</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercedes X-Class V6 — A Craftsman's Dream]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Mercedes pickups now finally come with a real <span class="caps">V6</span> engine, which makes them almost perfect.
  Enliven took this marvel of craftsmanship out for a test-drive.</p>

  <p>Pickups are mainly associated with the US, and then with rumbling V8 engines, but in fact the Ford F150 pickup is the
  world&#39;s most sold car. As of today, Europe stands for quite a few of those sales but the trend to drive pickups has
  exploded and even Mercedes has hopped on the bandwagon with its model X-Class.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Driving fuel-thirsty pickups in Europe is not politically correct, but European buyers are not content with just
  anything</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Just like the Renault Alaska, the X-Class is basically modeled on the Nissan Navara, something some were not quite
  happy with. It was thought that Mercedes with all their rough terrain models should&rsquo;ve been able to build a pickup
  based on their own designs. Just take the G-Class, for example, which is considered the world&#39;s best off-road car.
  So when the X-Class arrived with its four-cylinder engine, many were left disappointed.</p>

  <p>But now the X-Class has been released with a Mercedes-produced three and a half liter, 258 horsepower, V6 engine.
  With the new V6 engine the X-Class really feels like it&rsquo;s come into its own. There is plenty of power to go around
  and the engine works quietly, even at higher speeds and RPM&rsquo;s. And as long as you have the license for it, you can
  tow up to 3500 kilos behind an X-Class V6.</p>

  <p>When the V6 update came, some other updates followed. For example, the dreary gearshift housing disappeared which was
  too reminiscent of the Navara. Now it&#39;s just a straight gap where the lever runs for the six-speed automatic box.
  Behind the gear selector is a panel with various controls, including the wheel that one rotates to interact with the
  various functions on the center screen.</p>

  <p>Also located here is the slider to select driving mode. The X-Class V6 is equipped with five different modes:
  Comfort, Eco, Sport, Manual and Off-road &ndash; the handling can be optimized to any situation. Moreover, you can set
  the permanent four-wheel drive in three different modes: 4H for easier off-road driving, 4L for difficult terrain and
  4Mat for driving on a normal road. Rear differential lock is available as an extra.</p>

  <p>Among the many pickups on the market, the X-Class belongs to the safest. Among the security systems available, the
  main stars are the course-correction system and the assisted brake system which can intervene should the situation
  require it. Also, there is a system for stabilizing trailers, and should an accident happen, the X-Class features an
  emergency call-dial system.</p>

  <p>What also distinguishes the X-Class from other pickups is that it has Keyless Go, which means you can keep the key in
  your pocket when starting the car. All you have to do is press the start button. In order to simplify parking there is a
  360-degree camera which captures the area around the car and displays it on the central screen.</p>

  <p>The X-Class V6 offers a compelling package, especially thanks to the new engine. Getting this type of comfort in a
  pickup is a rare sight to be seen. Without a doubt, a V8 engine would be nice, and there are rumors that something of
  the sort could be in the works. But even a hybrid line would be nice and perhaps more politically correct to bring the
  pickups into the next phase of environmental awareness.</p>

  <p>The name Ford GT obliges, because behind the name there is a legend - the Ford GT40. In the early sixties, Ford&#39;s
  image began to fade. The first move was to introduce one of car history&#39;s most successful car launches, the Ford
  Mustang. With the Mustang Ford made a half-hearted venture into motorsport.</p>

  <p>The Mustang is a classic but it was not enough. Ford then tried to buy Ferrari, but Enzo said no when Ford demanded
  that the motor sports part of Ferrari would also be included, which Enzo would not agree to. When they did not succeed,
  they moved on to English Lola, and Eric Broadley, who accepted the offer.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Thus, Lola GT became the model for Ford GT40</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Mid-engine and a large V8 engine, 4.1-7 liters, 390-530 hp.&nbsp;In total, 105 cars were built, all designed for
  racing. The GT won Le Mans four times and to win there was Henry Ford II&#39;s mission.</p>

  <p>The new generation of Ford GT started out as a concept in connection with Ford celebrating 100 years as a car
  manufacturer. The GT exterior was very similar to the GT40, but otherwise a brand new car. A symbolic difference was
  that the GT40 was 40 inches high (1 m) while the GT is 3 inches higher.</p>

  <p>The concept was presented in 2002 at the Detroit Auto Show and in 2004 the production started and up until 2008,
  4,038 cars were manufactured. The first generation GT had a 5.4-liter pressure-fed V8 with 550 hp. 0-100 in 3.3 sec, top
  speed around 330 km/h.</p>

  <p>The next generation Ford GT was presented in 2015 and went into production 2016 - 50 years after the Ford GT40&#39;s
  first win in Le Mans 24 hour. In 2016, the new GT won its class at Le Mans.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Ford will make one car a day until 2020</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Not only will it be enormously expensive,&nbsp;but you also have to apply to be allowed to own a Ford GT. However, it
  is not enough to just apply; Ford places requirements on you for you to be approved. The requirements are that you
  should have owned the last generation GT, you have to drive the car often and also be active on social media.</p>

  <p>Four to five cars are supposed to be destined for Sweden and no doubt the new GT will become a classic and carry on
  its status as an icon.</p>

  new bull from San't Agata Bolognese.</p>

  <p>The luxury car brands that today do not have an SUV in their model program are easy to see. Yet, there are still a
  couple, including Ferrari, who did not adopt this type of car into their lineup. Lamborghini, on the other hand, was
  among the first to change when the military vehicle Cheetah launched with the model designation LM002. The engine in the
  LM002 was the same as the icon Countach, a well-sounding V12 engine of 5.7 liters.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em></em>When actor Sylvester Stallone bought an LM002, it got the appropriate nickname Rambo-Lambo<em></em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The name Urus originates from Aurochs which was a form of wild cattle found in Europe and Asia for millions of years.
  The last died in Poland in 1667 and in Swedish the name is uroxe. A then-time Urus could weigh as much as up to 1500
  kg.</p>

  <p>The shapes and designs of Urus differ from the crowd when compared to other SUV models. It is angular and sharp lines
  all over the body. Of course, it is no coincidence that Urus looks like this. The whole design is a direct connection to
  the other Lamborghini models and what one would like to talk about, the brand&#39;s DNA.</p>

  <p>The man behind Urus&#39;s appearance is called Mitja Borkert and has previously worked at Porsche and was responsible
  for models such as Panamera Sport Turismo, Macan and Mission e to name a few. In addition to his work as chief designer
  at Lamborghini Centro Stile and Urus, Mr. Borkert also participated in the design of the concept Terzo Millennio.</p>

  <p>Time has passed and there has been a lot of water under the bridges since LM002. To be precise, we are talking about
  32 years.</p>

  <p>The first model after Audi entered as the main owner and who became a success was Gallardo. There are still the
  brutal V12 cars left but when you now launch their new SUV Urus it became an engine with eight cylinders instead of
  twelve as with LM002. The newly developed V8 does not have to be ashamed of itself, as it has double turbo units
  generating 650 horsepower. Enough to send off this bull of 2.2 tons from stationary to one hundred in only 3.6
  seconds.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em></em>The top speed reaches 304 kilometers per hour, an exciting speed that makes Urus the world&#39;s fastest
  SUV<em></em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>From an environmental perspective, it is said that drivelines with hybrid solutions will be in the future. The
  electrification is also in progress at Lamborghini, which was shown in the concept Terzo Millennio, which was developed
  together with at MIT in the USA.</p>

  <p>To show the dynamic in Urus, the test drive is laid on the prestigious racing track Autodromo Vallelunga Piero
  Taruffi (founded in 1959) outside Rome. On the track, Urus really shows what the brand succeeded with, the slogan for
  the Urus project reads &quot;Since we made it possible&quot;. Thanks to its power and four-wheel steering, which also
  has the sibling Aventador S, Urus hugs the tarmack on every curve.</p>

  <p>On the track, you prefer to choose the driving program Corsa, one of six options available on a slider called Anima.
  In addition to the Corsa program, we also find Strada, Sport, Sabbia, Terra, and Neve. These controls are located in the
  middle of the center console where you would normally find a gear lever. Here is now a larger cluster of levers that you
  call Tamburo in Lamborghini language.</p>

  <p>Anima is located on the left side of Tamburon, on the right, there is a slider Lamborghini suitably chosen to call
  the Ego. With Ego, you choose how the car&#39;s character should be. You can choose how the driveline, steering, and
  chassis should behave if you do not find the pre-programmed settings that are available among the Anima programs.</p>

  <p>The slider that also contains the start button and the gear selector is called Anima, here you control most settings
  for how Urus should behave on or off the road.</p>

  <p>The fact that Urus is fast on the track was not that difficult to figure out. But when the test run continues off the
  track and on something that would be called a rally crossroad, it becomes difficult for the brain to keep up. Stones,
  soil and dust and a car for nearly two million kronor feel like a very bad combination.</p>

  <p>After a couple of turns on the offroad track, you can only say that the Italians have done a good job. With Urus,
  Lamborghini really shows you are on the road and where the car should be, not in any corner but proudly in the middle of
  the bullring with the dust roaring around.</p>

  <p>In this project I had to deal with a pre-existent&nbsp;cattle shed/warehouse/barn from the early &#39;900. Past
  generations built this building with sacrifices for the sustenance of their family,&nbsp;so&nbsp;to&nbsp;me it
  was&nbsp;necessary to take this into account, preserving as much as possible both from the point of view of materials
  and form. I believe that in the historical moment we are experiencing there is a need&nbsp;to revive buildings like
  this, to renew their history, to give back &ldquo;life&rdquo;&nbsp;to the materials of the past.</p>

  <p>On the external fa&ccedil;ades the plaster was kept as it was,&nbsp;while inside it was completely&nbsp;removed from
  the walls, bringing back to light the original stone. About the roof, both the supporting structure and the chestnut
  wood paneling and the covering layer in rusty corrugated sheet, have been maintained through recovery and
  restoration.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>It&rsquo;s still possible to protect and renew buildings that belong to our own&nbsp;history</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>All the openings have been respected by inserting wooden frames. The floor was made of concrete without any covering
  in order to re-propose the typical floors of the houses of the past. As for the lighting system, the same was done
  simply using simple cables to which the lights switches were connected.</p>

  <p>On the ground floor, in the portion of the building used as a stable for the animals, a tavern was built while the
  warehouse was transformed into a studio. On the first floor, in the original hayloft, a kitchen and a living room have
  been created, while the bedroom and the bathroom have been made into the old&nbsp;storage room.</p>

  <p>As in other projects, I gave room to the artisans work, which I consider fundamental to the growth and development of
  traditions. I have therefore designed a large part of the furnishings, making them custom-made: both the kitchen block
  and the fireplace were made of painted iron.&nbsp;The kitchen block was then completed with carpentry works (drawers and
  doors); also the bolts of the entrance doors have been commissioned to a skilled and expert locksmith. I describe this
  project as a recovery, because part of the furnishings (chairs, armchairs, wardrobes, chandeliers) have been
  &ldquo;saved&rdquo;&nbsp;from destruction, restored and re-used.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/architecture/barn-life</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/architecture/barn-life</guid><category><![CDATA[Architecture]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 10:00:20 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Marcello Mariana, Alfredo Vanotti</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Stonemasons Cottage ]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Tucked away in an Australian country town is this historic Stonemasons cottage, nestled in a thickly planted wild
  garden of grasses and perennials.</p>

  <p>Tucked away in the Victorian country town of Kyneton is Meadowbank, a tiny brick and stone cottage built by master
  stonemason Alexander Rodgers for his family in 1858.&nbsp;Alexander and his wife and eleven children lived here very
  happily for many years; today it is the home of an architect and a photographer, and their two whippets.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The cottage was built just after gold was discovered in Australia</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Kyneton is on the road to the goldfields, and back then was a wild frontier town like you might see in an old western
  movie.&nbsp;Kyneton was famous for pubs and brothels, and was a bit of a rough town where miners might lose their money
  on the way back to Melbourne.</p>

  <p>Today Kyneton has been discovered by &ldquo;sea-changers&rdquo;:&nbsp;people wanting to escape Melbourne,
  dissatisfied with city&nbsp;life and have a quieter life in the country, its now a town full of artists, designers,
  musicians architects, and photographers.</p>

  <p>The cottage is small and neat and built in the Georgian style, from locally quarried stone and hand-made
  bricks.&nbsp;Two bedrooms, a sitting room, dining room, bathroom, and a kitchen. The kind of house that looks like a

Maserati is, of course, no exception and
  their model Levante has found the right in the luxury-suction segment.</p>

  <p>Rome was not built in one day, and neither was the Maseratis SUV Levante. It took thirteen years to be precise. But
  being patient has its benefits.</p>

  <p>But introducing an SUV model with a brand like Maserati is nothing you do in a hurry.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em></em>For the model name Levante, Maserati has for many years used the names of different winds in the
  Mediterranean region<em></em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It started in 1963 with Mistral and was then followed by Bora, Merak, Ghibli and now Levante. The latter originates
  from the Levant (the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean). This wind gives rise to huge waves as it meets the
  Atlantic winds at Gibraltar and southern Portugal. It is a surfer&rsquo;s delight.</p>

  <p>Since the model Ghibli was reintroduced and the new Quattroporten came, the new design of Maserati&rsquo;s models has
  made their mark. Of course, this idiom is also found in Levante. A massive grill with the trident in the middle and
  narrow aggressive headlights on the outer edges. On the side behind the wheelhouse are the classic three air valves that
  are found on all Maserati models. Also on the c-pillar, we find a trident just like on other models.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, it is important to set their mark and recognition factor on car models. Although the car&#39;s round shapes
  can make it look small on the picture, the car is relatively large in reality. Size-wise, it competes with Porsche
  Cayenne and Jaguar F-Pace. When you step into Levante S, the Italian sporty luxury breathes with solid leather work and
  cool carbon fiber panels. The ceiling is self-dressed in black alcantara.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>T</em>The Treudden, which is part of Maseratis logotype, originates from the Roman sea god Neptune<em></em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Neptune is always depicted with a trident in the hand. A fishing gear that is also called light. On the other hand,
  if Neptunus runs a Maserati, we sound unsaid.</p>

  <p>When the start button is pressed, which is to the left of the steering wheel, the engine starts to move. The heart of
  Levante S is a three-liter V6 engine with double turbo and 430 horses. The sound this machine generates, and which comes
  out of the four pipes at the back, is magical and exactly as an Italian sports car should sound. But in order to achieve
  the absolute optimum sound, you have to push in the sports button, the engine yells in a phenomenal way and one can only
  state that Maserati can do this with Italian motor song.</p>

  <p>Because this is a luxury SUV, it has air suspension that makes the journey a joy. You hover over clouds and the car
  decides which height above the ground you should &quot;hover&quot; forward depending on the speed you have. The normal
  height is 21 centimeters but at higher speeds, the car goes down to 17.</p>

  <p>Despite its size and weight, the car is really sporty on the curvy track. The car&rsquo;s steering gives you a nice
  presence to what is happening under the tires. To bring down the power from the engine to the tires, there is a keyed
  automatic transmission. During normal driving, all power is delegated to the rear wheels, but if necessary, it can be
  moved 50 percent of the drive to the front wheels.</p>

New, exciting restaurants are opening at a furious pace. Tove Oskarsson Henckel gives
  you eleven great tips for a culinary weekend in Estonia's capital, all at budget-friendly prices.</p>

  <p>Only a stone&#39;s throw from Sweden lies Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, whose restaurant scene has gained a major
  boost in recent years. Here is well-known fine dining in the form of&nbsp;NOA Chef&rsquo;s Table and Tchaikovsky, but it
  is the simple, artisan-driven taverns that give the city its&nbsp;pulse.</p>

  <p>Estonia has come a long way since the country became independent in 1991. Traditional cooking was based on peasant
  culture and was more about surviving than about flavors. Importing fresh goods is costly, and you just have to make it
  with what you have.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Chefs and bartenders who left the country are now bringing back new experiences and influences from all the major
  capitals and food meccas</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>One of these chefs is Peeter Pihel with experience from Estonian P&auml;hdaste Manor, and Swedish restaurants such as
  Vollmers in Malm&ouml; and F&auml;viken Magazine in J&auml;rpen. Today he runs Kotzebue Bakery &amp; Charcuterie in
  Tallinn. An insignificant store where the Tallinn residents can buy charcuteries such as salami, coppa, bresaola, and
  culatello - all done on local meat. And from the oven, scents of Estonian classic rye bread and sourdough bread based on
  dinkel- and buckwheat.</p>

  <p><em>- I like it a lot here. Many producers in Estonia do not know how to make charcuteries with the right kind of
  mold, temperature and aging time. When I came back to Tallinn from F&auml;viken Magazine, where I was for three and a
  half years and also worked with their charcuteries, I saw a gap in the market, </em>says Peeter, who opened Kotzebue
  Bakery &amp; Charcuterie just a year ago together with Maido Maiste from P&auml;hdaste Manor.</p>

  <p>Of course, all chark and bread are crafted in smaller quantities, but getting hold of organic meat has been a
  challenge:&nbsp;<em>unfortunately</em><em>, we have had swine fever,&nbsp;that made it difficult. Many farmers also want
  to produce far too fast&rdquo;.</em></p>

  <p>Locals come to Kotzebue to shop, but most of the produce goes to restaurants. People like Peeter make Tallinn a
  culinary interesting destination right now, but the rapid pace of new restaurants opening make it a slightly more risky
  proposition to find the ones worth a visit. Not to worry, we have therefore hand-picked the list that we right now are
  worth a visit!</p>

  <p><em><sub><strong>Kotzebue Bakery &amp;
  </strong></sub><strong><sub>Charkuterie</sub></strong></em><sub><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em><br />
  Peeter Pihel left F&auml;viken Magazine in J&auml;rpen after 3.5 years and returned home to Tallinn. Today he runs a
  charcuterie and bakery together with Maido Maiste, whom he worked with at P&auml;hdaste Manor. Everything is locally
  produced and with a high level of craftsmanship. Rye bread, sourdough bread, salami, and bresaola are some of the
  well-made goodies that can be bought over the counter. <em>facebook.com/KotzebueBakery</em></sub></p>

  <p><sub><em><strong>Kaja Pizza K&ouml;&ouml;k</strong></em><br />
  Be prepared to queue for Kaja Pizza K&ouml;&ouml;k, because here Estonia&#39;s most delicious pizza is made. The
  pizza&#39;s&nbsp;sourdough bread is baked on Caputo flour, the tomato sauce is, of course, made with San Marzano and the
  cheese is Italian mozzarella. The stone oven is made in Italy, and the pizza is baked in 500 degrees. Kaja Pizza
  K&ouml;&ouml;k has only a few places and does not take table bookings.&nbsp;<em>kajapizza.ee</em></sub></p>

  <p><em><sub><strong>Salt</strong></sub></em><br />
  <sub>SALT opened five years ago by Tiina Treumann, a self-taught and enthusiastic foodie. The restaurant was immediately
  named Tallinn&#39;s best new restaurant. Tiina still runs the place but devotes most of her time to eating, traveling
  and cooking dishes with her kitchen team. The dishes are heavily influenced by the owner&#39;s travels around the world.
  Right now she is getting inspiration mainly from Japan and Peru. The menu is updated frequently but has, of course, some
  signature dishes, such as Thai-inspired mussel soup with coconut and tomato
  sauce.&nbsp;<em>saltrestoran.ee</em></sub></p>

  <p><sub><em><strong>Rae Meierei</strong></em><br />
  In the middle of the Old Town is Rae Meierei, a cool project from the owners of the well-known beer restaurant Beer
  House. Just like at Beer House, where the beer is brewed in the restaurant, the cheese is also made at Rae Meierei. Here
  guests can enjoy burrata, halloumi, mozzarella, and ricotta - which come directly from the restaurant&#39;s own dairy.
  Other cheeses, however, are purchased. Manufacturing can be followed through the
  window.&nbsp;<em>raemeierei.ee</em></sub></p>

  <p><em><sub><strong>NOP Caf&eacute;</strong></sub></em><br />
  <sub>NOP stands for Neighborhood Organic Place, and it has become one of the&nbsp;main places for many Tallinn
  residents. A gem for anyone who wants an organic breakfast, brunch or lunch consisting of, for example, salmon and
  poached eggs, porridge, pancakes and smoothie with sea buckthorn, turmeric and ginger. There are plenty of healthy
  alternatives, and in addition to the caf&eacute;, there is also a small shop for those who want to shop and take it
  home.&nbsp;<em>blog.nop.ee</em></sub></p>

  <p><sub><em><strong>Parrot</strong></em><br />
  The restaurant with the slightly odd name Parrot is centrally located in Tallinn. Here you will find some of the
  city&#39;s trendiest guests to enjoy drinks and food served in a mini-format. You choose between three different menus -
  a snack menu, a mini mains menu that is served in pairs, and a tasting menu that is eaten with tweezers. The decoration
  is inspired by the Amazon, and the food also has some South American influences. If you only want to enjoy Parrot&#39;s
  drinks, you can book a table in the restaurant&#39;s speakeasy, decadently decorated in the
  basement.&nbsp;<em>facebook.com/parrotminibar</em></sub></p>

  <p><em><sub><strong>Leib Resto &amp; Aed</strong></sub></em><br />
  <sub>&quot;Leib&quot; is Estonian for black bread and refers to the country&#39;s traditional dark rye bread. The owners
  Janno Lepik, chef, and Kristjan Pe&auml;ska, sommelier, work in close contact with the suppliers, which means that food
  is cooked on local ingredients. The menu is, of course, adapted after the season, and at Leib Resto &amp; Aed you can
  also taste homemade liqueurs on, among other things, rowan berries and
  lingonberries.&nbsp;<em>leibresto.ee</em></sub></p>

  <p><sub><em><strong>Porgu</strong></em><br />
  Do you love beer? Then you should head to Porgu where you can taste Porgus&#39; own beer and a very large selection of
  Estonian varieties. The pub is down a staircase in the basement, and you should not be discouraged by the little
  unpleasant smell from the toilets outside the large wooden door. Once inside you can enjoy nice service as well as food
  and drink in a rustic medieval environment.&nbsp;<em>porgu.ee</em></sub></p>

  <p><sub><em><strong>R&oslash;st</strong></em><br />
  You can find this small bakery&nbsp;in a newly renovated part of Tallinn. In the area, we find several small interesting
  shops and beverage shops, including Tap Tap and Mikkeller. Behind the counter, guests get an insight into the
  bakery&#39;s daily work. When kneaded, bread is pushed into the oven and then steamed out. Of course, it smells lovely
  here, and everything is incredibly tasty. However, the menu is relatively short and consists mainly of bread, cinnamon
  buns, sandwiches and a couple of cakes served with tea or coffee from handicraft
  breweries.&nbsp;<em>rost.ee</em></sub></p>

  <p><sub><em><strong>Tap Tap</strong></em><br />
  Yummy hot dogs and bumblebee beer. At Tap Tap you can choose from 230 beers from around the world. Of course, there are
  also craft beers from Estonia. The sausages are inspired by the street food culture in Denmark and are available in two
  variants, also served with beer juice, ketchup, pickles, and pickled red onions. The recipes are made by Peeter Pihel,
  and the bread&nbsp;comes from Kotzebue Bakery. Tap Tap</sub><sub> is just a few meters from
  R&oslash;st.&nbsp;<em>taptap.ee</em></sub></p>

  <p><sub><em><strong>Whisper Sister</strong></em><br />
  After a few years abroad, mainly in Copenhagen and London, four friends returned to Tallinn. Everyone had worked in the
  restaurant industry and wanted to open a place where they would like to go. The result was Whisper Sister, a speakeasy
  bar with excellent drinks, both with and without alcohol, snacks and a relaxed atmosphere. Whisper Sister is a bar for
  those who want to hang out without congestion. Please book your place via Facebook, Instagram or phone. On the drink
  list, we find, among other things, Rye Bread with both whiskey and eggs, Truffled Old Fashioned and
  Dill-licious</sub><sub> with rum and plum and
  </sub><sub>dillylt</sub><sub>.&nbsp;<em>facebook.com/whispersisterbar</em></sub></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>Get to Tallinn -&nbsp;</strong></em>The easiest way to get to Tallinn from Sweden is with Tallink Silja
  who goes from V&auml;rtahamnen in Stockholm. You can also fly directly with Air Baltic.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/culinary-weekend-tallinn</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/culinary-weekend-tallinn</guid><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 09:16:26 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Tove Oskarsson Henckel</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Healthy Granola With Fruit, Seeds and Nuts]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>This is a great set of healthy granola, that you can sweeten with honey, maple syrup … Take whatever you have:

  Tyson!</p>

  <p>The American way of thinking and constructing cars has always been different from what we are used to in Europe. The
  Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat is very clear proof of this. European muscle cars, such as the BMW M5, the Mercedes E63 AMG
  and the Audi RS6 itself, is fading in comparison to the Hellcat&rsquo;s power.</p>

  <p>We are not talking about a few tens of horsepower here but over a hundred horses more than the Germans. Hellcat has
  as much as 717 horsepower or 707 depending on how you measure it. Regardless of how you measure it&nbsp;will blow your
  mind. To mash out this power a compressor had been added to the massive 6.2-liter Hemi V8 engine, which gives the engine
  a torque of 881 Nm. This makes it the strongest and fastest sedan in the world.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The name Dodge Charger has been an icon in the US ever since 1966</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Who doesn&#39;t remember the movies &quot;Bullit&quot; with Steve McQueen and &ldquo;The Fast and the
  Furious&rdquo;&nbsp;with Paul Walker.&nbsp;The model was discontinued in 1978 but returned in 2005, and in 2014 the
  special model Hellcat was presented. A Hellcat is the same things as a wild cat but the word has become a symbol of a
  person with violent and unpredictable temperament, especially a woman.</p>

  <p>What is also significant for American cars is that they are beyond comfortable. The Hellcat adheres to this too.
  Alcantara-clad seats that feel more like comfortable armchairs than car seats. The chairs have really good support which
  may be needed when the car starts to move fast and the road turns. In addition, you will find all possible technology
  and a powerful sound system that makes the journey in a Hellcat very pleasant.</p>

  <p>To start the engine, simply press a button. With a right proper roar, the engine starts and it is impossible to
  mistake this for a Toyota Prius or any other &ldquo;greener&rdquo;&nbsp;car. Despite the muscles, the Charger Hellcat
  has an Eco mode where the engine and gearbox are re-mapped for more efficient driving. However, that&rsquo;s not
  something we intend to immerse ourselves in here and now.</p>

  <p>The gearbox is an 8-speed Torqueflite automatic with traditional gear selector and paddles on the steering wheel.
  With the gear in Drive and you will barely have time to think of taking it easy on&nbsp;the gas until a plume of smoke
  is coming out of the rear tires. Even with stability control fully switched on, the car does not manage to hold the grip
  on the asphalt. And so it goes on, Hellcat has so much power that it gladly spins in almost all gears.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>It&#39;s not often I get scared behind the wheel of powerful cars</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Hellcat, on the other hand, is a little different, it is so fiercely powerful from the start and the back tires are
  too narrow, which means that the fight for the grip is always a losing match for the tires. Straight ahead, this is not
  just a fast car, this is rather like a missile and the howl from the compressor is a delight to the ear.</p>

  <p>If one manages to transfer the grip, downwards it only takes 3.5 seconds to reach the 100-line mark on the meter. If
  you have a sufficiently long and straight road section, Hellcat can reach up to 328 kilometers per hour! To keep track
  of things, there are a number of menus to browse through them on the screen of the dashboard.</p>

  <p>Here you can follow your rotational speed, G-force, and top speed and more. You can also change the settings of the
  car completely to your own wishes. You can choose between 500 horses or 700+, softer or harder suspension, faster
  gearbox and much more. Just to make the car behave as you like.</p>

  <p>The German muscle cars are probably a wiser option than a Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat. But at the same time, they will
  never give you the delight mingled with terror produced by a Hellcat. Just as the name says, this is a wild cat from
  hell!</p>

Nowadays he runs The Raby Hunt, a two star Michelin restaurant in
  Darlington, England.  An autodidact that with an incredible focus, stubbornness and talent has creates a unique food
  experience in the English countryside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some ideas make no sense, even when they succeed&rdquo;, writes Jay Rayner, a culinary writer for The
  Guardian, in a review in 2015. He concludes: &ldquo;Close is an impressive young chef with some very good ideas, who is
  still finding his voice. It&rsquo;s already one to which we should listen&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>These words roll around in my head&nbsp;as&nbsp;I am approaching the restaurant. On the meadow next to it, cows
  graze, and the horses are curiously looking out of the fence. The beautiful stone building from the end of the 19th
  century has been renovated ground up, and it is hard to believe that The Raby Hunt previously housed a pub. James and
  his parents took it over in 2010, and at that time traditional English pub food was served here.</p>

  <p>James belongs to a&nbsp;small crowd of self-taught restaurateurs who changed profession and learned to cook at a very
  high gastronomic level. Another autodidact is the Swedish restaurateur Mikael J&ouml;nsson, who runs Hedone in Chiswick,
  London. Both restaurant owners have a geeky stubbornness in common. They are perfectionists, both equally unlikely to
  leave&nbsp;their restaurant kitchen.</p>

  <p>James grew up in the small town of Bishop Auckland, a few miles away from Darlington. He dreamed of a life as a golf
  pro, but didn&#39;t have what it took&nbsp;to get out on the tour. Instead, he started working&nbsp;in a golf shop,
  giving&nbsp;lessons.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>I didn&#39;t want to work there all my life but didn&#39;t know what to do instead</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This was around eight years ago. The UK economy was wobbling, and the pub in Darlington was up for&nbsp;sale for a
  reasonable asking price. James&#39;s mother had experience in running a restaurant kitchen with the idea&nbsp;that James
  would go out in the world and learn the profession; however, he quickly realized he would rather go straight into the
  kitchen at The Raby Hunt. As his passion&nbsp;for cooking became more intense, he began to frequently travel&nbsp;and
  eat at some of the very best restaurants around the globe. One of the most memorable restaurant visits was at El Celler
  de Can Roca, in Girona.</p>

  <p><em>I was obsessed with eating at top restaurants. I had dedicated my entire life to a golfing career and failed. Now
  I got a chance to do something new. People think I got money from my parents, but I didn&rsquo;t. I made my own money.
  When I was off, I traveled. I used to wake up in the middle of the night and write down ideas. I did research and tried
  dishes in the middle of the night. I never write down recipes but remember everything by heart,</em> says James, who had
  to learn to cook from scratch.</p>

  <p>Ingredients are incredibly important in James cooking today, and he quickly developed his creative side.
  &ldquo;Certainly, I have become much better and more skilled, yet I am far from being where I want to be. The world is
  so big. I feel no fear, always seeking&nbsp;to further develop&nbsp;my skills&rdquo;.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The first star came as a shock</em>. <em>The second one, on the other hand, felt more awaited</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It turned out that James was a fast learner, and two years later the first big accolade&nbsp;came. The restaurant
  received a star in the Michelin Guide. And five years ago something extraordinary&nbsp;happened that would affect both
  the restaurant and James&#39;s personal life. The pastry chef&nbsp;Maria Guseva from Moscow stepped in through the
  door.</p>

  <p><em>It was the only restaurant with a star in the area, </em>Maria says. <em>And it was already one of the best
  restaurants&nbsp;I ever visited. The flavors were pure&nbsp;and everything was delicious. I remember complaining about
  the caviar; it was not of the highest&nbsp;quality at that time.</em></p>

  <p>Maria then started working in the kitchen at The Raby Hunt, and soon she and James became&nbsp;a couple. They live,
  travel and cook together. Maria has also worked in Japan and recently came home from an internship at the three-star El
  Celler de Can Roca, where she worked alongside the dessert genius Jordi Roca.</p>

  <p>Outside the door of The Raby Hunt stands&nbsp;a statue in the form of a hunting dog. The house was previously part of
  the castle Raby Estate, which is one of the area&#39;s most visited attractions. People used to gather at The Raby Hunt
  after the hunt for a drink. The restaurant has been renovated in stages, most recently in the summer of 2017 after it
  received its second star.</p>

  <p><em>We felt confident to invest in the Raby Hunt. Two-star restaurants are unusual in England, there are only
  eighteen, and this has made us a destination restaurant. We have many English guests who travel around and visit
  two-star places, but also some international foodies, </em>says James.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>There are few English places on the list, and they are all in London. Guide Michelin is extremely important to us
  in the countryside</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The kitchen at The Raby Hunt has been upgraded, and at the chef&rsquo;s table guests sit at a bar counter and
  enjoying James and his chef&#39;s craftsmanship. The skull, which has become a bit of James and Maria&#39;s signature,
  is available as a work of art, and the tables have white cloths that should be in a restaurant for haute cuisine.</p>

  <p>The 15-course menu starts with a small pommes souffl&eacute;e with oyster emulsion. Then comes something that in
  theory should an erratic&nbsp;introduction. First a scallop with lime and jalape&ntilde;o, then crab and piglet tacos,
  followed by nigiri with wagyu and sea urchin. The influences transcending from Mexico to Peru and Japan.</p>

  <p><em>Actually, there is a common theme when we go from one country to another, but I understand what you mean,
  </em>James says.&nbsp;<em>I cook what I like, and it doesn&#39;t always have to be so strictly composed.</em></p>

  <p>The menu continues with a&nbsp;freshly prepared temp-freaked lobster with sudachi and a hint of sanchope pepper. It
  is crispy and extremely well-prepared. A small spicy touch is something that often comes back to James. Then a signature
  dish is served where the shell of the artichoke is roasted and dried and then filled with a rag on chicken heart, liver
  and intestines. Everything is topped with grated, cold foie gras frozen with nitroglycerin. This&nbsp;small bite is
  served with hazelnuts and cherry puree. Hot, cold, crunchy, umami and a little sweet. All in one bite.</p>

  <p>The dinner goes on with one flavor sensation after the other. Here, Jay Rayner&#39;s words begin to take shape. Some
  things should not work, but James Close makes it work. The difference to many other restaurants is that each
  dish&nbsp;stands so strong in itself that when the evening is over, one already longs to start over.</p>

  <p><em>James would like to have a few words with you before he goes home for tonight</em>,&nbsp;says the head waiter. I
  go out into the hall. James handshake is hot and some small drops of sweat are on his forehead. For James, one evening
  in the kitchen is not just about creating fantastic food; it is about working focused and dedicated and giving 110
  percent. A mentality that characterizes a professional athlete. When we meet the next day, he says:</p>

  <p><em>In my head it&#39;s exactly like that. I am manic as a Formula 1 driver or a golf pro. I give my everything and
  want to get better every day. Now we are preparing for tonight. It is like a football team on training for an important
  game. The difference is that we have a new game&nbsp;every night&rdquo;.</em></p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/james-close-self-taught-genius-darlington</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/gourmet-travel/james-close-self-taught-genius-darlington</guid><category><![CDATA[Gourmet travel]]></category><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 09:31:50 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Tove Oskarsson Henckel</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Skiing the Arctic — a Powder Junkie's Guide to Western Greenland]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Skiing on Greenland had long been an exotic dream. Martin Letzter and Fredrik Schenholm decided to do a expedition 
  using a combination of boat, tent, skins and leg power, and traveled to the ice-covered island to find the best skiing
  that Northern Europe has to offer.</p>

  <p>Our local driver carefully navigates through the floating ice, before the water in front of us turns into a compact
  floating layer of ice. With smoke from the engine in the cold afternoon air we slowly push through 500m of increasingly
  thick ice. Often by backing up, and charging the ice with our poor fiberglass hull.</p>

  <p>Two hours after departing Maniitsoq we finally reach our destination and find an ice-free bay where we can go ashore.
  &quot;See you in eight days!&quot; is the last thing we hear before the little boat leaves us alone in our new home.</p>

  <p>We made our way to Greenland by air to Kangerlussuq and Maniitsoq, via Copenhagen. Quickly gathered supplies for a
  week&#39;s stay and have now made the final 40 nautical mile voyage by boat.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>1500 meters high alpine peaks, in an unprecedented concentration with the dark waters of the North Atlantic in
  the background</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After quickly setting up camp in the sustained snowfall, we take a 2h reconnaissance trip to find a route up to the
  peninsula&rsquo;s glaciers and make the trip&#39;s first powder turns down to the camp as night falls. Dinner is taken
  in the tents as we plan for tomorrow. Anxious to beat the two helicopters we know operate in the area, we agree on an
  alpine start to stand on our first peak already at 09.00 the next morning.</p>

  <p>After an all too short rest, we leave the camp at 05.00. The snowfall has finally stopped and as the sun&#39;s first
  rays begin to burn away the morning clouds, the mood rises. Slowly a fantastic landscape is revealed around us. 1500
  meters high alpine peaks, in an unprecedented concentration with the dark waters of the North Atlantic in the
  background.</p>

  <p>After 4h of skinning through 20 cm of powder, we reach our first summit, and lose our breath as we gaze at the
  surrounding area. The nearest square kilometers around the Evighedsfjord have been populated with more skiable peaks
  than the Alps of France, Switzerland and Austria combined.</p>

  <p>There are no valleys or other barriers between the mountains, and the alpine peaks sit so close together that one
  could throw a rock from one to another. And between them, the powder lies ready for us in a wide range of
  constellations, from wide snow fields to narrow couloirs. We need not worry about the heliskiers and realize that you
  would need a lifetime of heli-time to cover all possible lines we can identify, just from this vantage point.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>You quickly realize that you would need a lifetime of heli-time to cover all possible lines we can identify, just
  from this vantage point</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We relax, and focus on what we came here to do. Point our skis downwards and start skiing the coolest lines the area
  the area has to offer. Three peaks and about 2500 meters were&nbsp;skied the first day, in as close to perfect powder
  conditions as you can find, before we cruise back to camp for a tasty dinner in the dug out kitchen pit.</p>

  <p>The surroundings are impressive with large, slow glaciers that flow over the terrain and sometimes offer as fun
  skiing as the peaks surrounding them. We use ropes but never need to test their dynamic properties. Instead, we continue
  to link up great runs of between 500-1200 meters each, in 8-10 hour day trips out of our camp, without ever having to
  repeat a run. Stable sub-zero temperatures and the lack of strong wind make the snow safe, light and inviting in all
  aspects.</p>

  <p>After a rest day with renewed snowfall, we steer east along the coast to meet the Greenland ice cap. Five kilometers
  of touring through narrow valleys bring us to the point where the ice cap forms the link between the mainland and our
  peninsula.</p>

  <p>The massive glacier is pushed out towards our peninsula and forms a T-junction where it crashes into a vast mountain
  massif, turning 90 degrees in either direction, and heads down towards the fjords. It&#39;s an impressive sight. With an
  edge of over 100 meters, the glacier abruptly drops into the ocean in front of us, with a few icebergs serving as signs
  of the constant calving.</p>

  <p>One of the most spectacular runs of our lives slowly takes us from our look out point 800 meters above sea level and
  down to the beach where large and crystal clear square blocks of ice have stranded on their journey out to sea. We
  admire the view, eating our lunch sandwiches and wash them down with pure water from a thousand-year old glacier. The
  fact that the oldest parts of the Greenland ice sheet have been dated to 110,000 years ago, makes us wonder how old the
  ice we are drinking really is.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The landscape is reminiscent of Norway&#39;s fjords, but on steroids</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is impossible not to be enchanted by Greenland and its scenery. Everything is big, but in some way inviting and
  welcoming.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the Danish state, basic infrastructure has been built up in a number of communities around the island,
  meaning that a visit now does not need to involve an expedition. A total of about 56,000 inhabitants live scattered
  along the west and east coast of the island (more than 6 times larger than Germany).</p>

  <p>The villages are beautiful with colorful houses in varying shades of red, blue, green and yellow. All in stark
  contrast to the spectacular backdrop of snow-covered peaks, glaciers and extremely productive waters. Seals, walruses
  and whale species such as humpbacks, minke whales and beluga whales are just a few examples of animals often seen in the
  area.</p>

  <p>We end our last day in the Evighetsfjord by crossing the peninsula and getting a fantastic spring snow run down a
  40&deg; glacier that stretches all the way to the northern shore. The powder from the first days has now turned to a new
  base, which yesterday&#39;s snowfall has generously added to. Huge plumes of powder spring from our skis as we make our
  descent in the May-sun, skiing the long and steep slopes towards the sea.</p>

  <p>The north side of the island, in contrast to our campsite, offers direct access to a couple of steep mountain sides,
  where the snow-covered rocks resemble large pillows and form an unbelievable adult playground. And with one of our
  favorite runs as the access point to the alternative northern shore (and camp site) we now know where to pitch our tents
  the next time we visit the peninsula.</p>

  <p>Happy with our week, we pack up our skis, tents and camera equipment for the boat trip back to Maniitsoq, a couple of
  cold beers and tasty whale steak. The next day we board our flight south and leave Greenland for the time being,
  determined not to wait too long before visiting this area again.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/adventure-expeditions/skiing-arctic-powder-junkies-guide-western-greenland</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/adventure-expeditions/skiing-arctic-powder-junkies-guide-western-greenland</guid><category><![CDATA[Adventure & Expeditions]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 10:30:44 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Fredrik Schenholm, Martin Letzter</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla Model X 100D — An electrified rocket]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>If I said it will fly around a sports car in space a year ago, most people would think I was crazy. But now they do
  with Tesla!</p>

  <p>Elon Musk, who created Tesla, is undoubtedly one of the greatest pioneers of our time. In addition to Tesla, he is
  also behind the companies PayPal, SpaceX, and SolarCity. The latest bidding in his career was when he sent a rocket in
  space just a month ago, where he mounted his own Tesla Roadster in the nose.</p>

  <p>How Tesla changed the vision of the car does not really compare to how Apple changed our way of using mobile phones
  with the introduction of the iPhone, but it&#39;s not far from it. In Apple&#39;s case, it was really about reinventing
  the wheel and quite revolutionary.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>One has definitely put a lot of pressure on the rest of the car world and with the Volkswagen diesel scandal,
  almost all car brands have put more energy and money on accelerating the electrification of their cars</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The rear doors of the Tesla Model X open upwards. The front doors automatically shut down when pushing down the brake
  pedal. Everything in the Tesla Model X is high tech and it feels that this is a new era for cars similar to that when
  the iPhone was introduced.</p>

  <p>Tesla Model X is more a spacecraft than a car. Soundless and more powerful than many sports cars. Many think that
  Elon has wanted to take over the car world and become the biggest brand, as Apple did with iPhone. What Elon always
  wanted with Tesla is to speed up the electrification and therefore he has always had completely opened the books when it
  comes to Tesla&#39;s technology. German brands have not taken much of the technology since they always had their own
  technology, but it made them hurry, no doubt.</p>

  <p>The first model from Tesla came in 2008 and was a small two-way roadster based on a Lotus. Second out and the big
  success was Model S, which was introduced in 2009 and started to be sold in the US 2012 and 2013 in Sweden.</p>

  <p>The revolutionary feature of the Model S was the range, with the largest 100 kWh battery reaching up to 485 miles. A
  distance no commercial electric car ever been close to before. After Model S came the Model X and now Model 3 is also on
  track. A new Roadster has also been featured with a performance that disgraces the worst hypersport car.</p>

  <p>Model X is an SUV and large family vehicle combined. The molds are soft and bulky and to say that the car is
  beautiful would not be the truth. With a system setting, it is enough to approach the car, so that the front door opens
  automatically, and when you sit down and push down the brake pedal, the door closes. What really impresses with the
  doors is the rear passenger doors that open upwards such as wings and electrically.</p>

  <p>Attempting to account for all technology in Tesla X would take the rest of this magazine, which unfortunately is not
  possible. But nevertheless, to raise some highlights before talking about the driving experience itself is that the car
  is intelligent, it learns and remembers what you want.</p>

  <p>For example, it will remember your routes and automatically start looking for parking when you arrive at your
  destination and can park completely automatically. It can also drive completely on the road without even having to hold
  the steering wheel. However, it should not be completely autonomous because of driving laws.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>When you sit in the Tesla Model X and close the door, the car is ready. You do not need to press any buttons or
  twist a key. Tesla Model X is always ready for you</em>​​​​​​​</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>If you never run a Tesla Model X earlier and push the accelerator pedal in the bottom you will definitely get a
  rollercoaster rush throughout your body. Acceleration 0 to 100 runs in just 3.3 seconds depending on the battery size
  selected.</p>

  <p>This is faster than most super sports cars available! Model X has four electric motors that supply each wheel with
  power, which in other words makes it four-wheel driven. Practical both for winter roads and when the road turns and you
  want to drive actively. Model X feels great even when it goes really fast.</p>

  <p>There are really only two disadvantages to mention and one is the price of the Model X starting at 982,000 kr and for
  the car we tested, which was a 100D, is 1 179 300 kr. Certainly, you get a lot of car and technology for the money but
  it is still a high price.</p>

  <p>The second drawback is that you will have to charge at home, to stay in line with the taxis at the fast-charging
  stations will only ruin your day. The latter, however, is something we are sure will see disappear as the infrastructure
  is continuously expanding for electric cars. A Tesla Model X is definitely a car that will change your life and your way
  of looking at cars, maybe not as much as the iPhone for phones did but not far from. The future is definitely here and
  Elon is influencing it.<br />

  <p>On one of my many trips through Europe, I came to the German racing track, Bilster Berg. The course is located just
  southwest of Hanover and is a very unique course. It is privately owned and not directly intended for competitions, but
  more for driving and this is one of the reasons that Mercedes is often housed here to have test runs of their new
  models. What makes the course special is how advanced it is, hilly and with other track differences from a more
  conventional racing course. It is simply a very fun but hard-hitting course.<br />
  <br />
  The event I attended was about the presentation of the Mercedes AMG GT.</p>

  <p><br />
  &quot;Basically, it is the successor of the SLS model, a supersport car with front / center mounted V8 engine and enough
  space for two people&quot;<br />
  <br />
  In addition, the characteristic swing doors. The AMG GT is a slightly smaller car than SLS and can be perceived as a
  tamare. The AMG GT is not just a model but an entire family, but starting with the GT version. After GT, GT S, GT C, GT
  R, GT 4 and GT 3. GT, GT S and GT C are also available as Roadster version. Then the family has also been filled with a
  four-door version called a Coup&eacute;. For GT 4 and GT 3, these are track-ready versions that are not legal to drive
  on public roads.<br />
  <br />
  The press event we were invited to had a very tight schedule. Because the event involved driving on the track, they
  limited what we could do.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&quot;Releasing a bunch of journalists on their own on a track like this with a rear-wheel drive with 585 horsepower
  is not a good idea&quot;<br />
  <br />
  You had to drive three, four turns behind an instructor in a group of four cars. So exploring the boundaries is simply
  not possible. The sky had chosen to be constantly open and it rained so hard that the speed of the track could not
  exceed 30 kilometers per hour when the cars had R tires that have less tread than normal tires. The test drive of AMG GT
  R this day became completely meaningless.<br />
  <br />
  Because I had arrived at the event by car, and not by air as my colleagues, I had the opportunity to try the track again
  the next day. Now there was no rain in the sky and the track began to dry up. As the only journalist in place, I first
  had to follow one of the instructors on a lap to warm up the tires in the car I would drive. Then followed drove behind
  after him for at least twenty minutes. The speed was increased every turn and as the track and the railing line dried
  up.<br />
  <br />
  I have experience driving fast cars, but the last five laps were the incredibly fast and undoubtedly a test to my own
  ability. Had it not been for the instructor giving me direction, I could not keep such a high pace. The feeling of
  getting into a curve without braking and full throttle and relying fully on what the clever instructor did before was
  incredibly cool. This really gave me the opportunity to know what Mercedes managed to accomplish with AMG GT R.<br />
  <br />
  Along with the other AMG GT models, Mercedes has created an entire family of sporty cars. If you just want a little more
  sporty car, but not interested in intense driving, then you choose GT or GT S, if you do not care to drive on public
  roads and just want to drive or maybe even compete, it&#39;s is the GT 4, or GT 3 models you&#39;re going to peek at.<br

  <p>Tired of paying tons of money for mediocre food in Paris? Check out this guide by Daniella Illerbrand as she
  illustrates the best affordable restaurants to hit up on your next trip to Paris.</p>

  <p>Paris as a food town has always been seen with romantic eyes, but today many tourist traps take advantage of this
  reputation. Despite this, we can now say with confidence that the food in Paris has never been as good or as varied as
  today. The French bistro experience has been updated and has a whole new feeling. Modern restaurants today have
  inspiration from all the world&#39;s countries and Paris now feels like an integrated food town.</p>

  <p>Coffee also has had a good boost, as seen with the Belleville coffee roasthouse, which has some of the best coffee
  sold around town. And of course with wine, and here there is really something for everyone, but most of the time,
  it&#39;s the natural wine bars that take over most neighborhoods. And of course, you can eat out without spending a
  fortune!</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Chez Aline</strong><br />
  <sub>In this locale as before, a butcher who worked mainly with horse meat may now have Paris&#39;s best stuffed
  baguettes, with everything from pate, artichoke, rabbit, pesto, potatoes, and cheese is all possible, so you can get a

This timeless ying and yang duo always remains a
  popular choice for our living spaces.</p>

  <p>Transcending&nbsp;seasons, countries and cultures in many ways,&nbsp;there is a little bit of black and white in
  everything. It is&nbsp;neither warm nor cold, neither dark nor light, this is why it works. From the classic chequered
  floors of well worn classic caf&eacute;s of Paris to the traditional Mexican embroidery patterns, pared-down design in
  Scandi minimalism or the opulent colonnaded interiors of Venice with their rich marble and black glass Murano
  chandeliers.</p>

  <p>We all love a bit of black and white. In this simple home in Cape Town the owner has mixed design classics with junk
  shop finds and elements sourced from nature. Burnt black protea tree stems live in handcrafted irregular white vessels,
  black clay bowls are used for casual meals, and photographs are preserved in simple black frames. Some might say its a
  bit of everything, all held together by this powerful color combination.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Rough linen cushions are embroidered with images of their two cats and favorite drawings&rdquo;​​​​​</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Black and white homes are disciplined and easy to live in. Simple white spaces can be transformed by black and white
  photographs, black hemp bed linen, or an old table lovingly restored by spraying it black and paring it with a set of
  white ever classic Panton chairs. In this space, the owner has added texture to the mixed, old-weathered workstations,
  hand-knitted throws and roughly-crafted black clay crockery all add a soulful, earthy touch.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/homes/black-and-white</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/homes/black-and-white</guid><category><![CDATA[Homes]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 09:32:42 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Shelley Street</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[The body is waiting for the mind to catch up]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>The gym is called Center of Mass Destruction, inspired by the infamous Gym Jones in Salt Lake City, aka House of
  Pain. Military personnel and actors left a bit of their soul in the gym in order to transform into superheroes.</p>

  <p>This is the story of how I discovered a groundbreaking gym in Motala called &nbsp;Center of Mass Destruction (CMD).
  The founder of the CMD, Mario Donato, is a disciple of infamous Gym Jones in Salt Lake City, aka House of Pain. Military
  and actors left a bit of their soul in the gym to form their bodies into superheroes.</p>

  <p>Mario is out on a crusade to create one of the most intense gyms, and if you want to achieve a superhero&rsquo;s
  level, you need to push yourself longer than you ever imagined possible.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>As Winston Churchill said, if you go through hell, keep going</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The gym started out as an overnight sensation. They went from a per-invite-only gym to sudden fame when the movie
  &ldquo;300&rdquo; premiered and turned the gym into a fitness mecca. Their website went from a few hundred hits a month
  to astonishing 13 million.</p>

  <p>June 2015, I was driving up to Gym Jones. I had expected a big sign above the door saying something like &ldquo;we
  have been training the Spartans since 480 BC&rdquo;. I do not see a sign. Instead, there is a tiny Gym Jones logo down
  in the left corner of a big dark window pane.</p>

  <p>I greet the Gym Jones head coach and general manager Rob MacDonald, aka Booby Maximus. The only thing that makes Rob
  happier than when people reach their goals in the gym is when they miss them with a calorie or a fraction of a second.
  &ldquo;Only girls watching Frozen for the first time could be as happy&ldquo;.</p>

  <p>When you fail, Rob commands, &ldquo;Do it again until you f**king succeed!&ldquo;. Now, I understand why Rob stared
  at me with anger only seen in the Hulk. Rob&rsquo;s energy can be seen in many instances in the gym.&nbsp;&ldquo;So this
  guy Freddie comes dressed in spandex shorts, a white t-shirt, five-toed shoes and a sweatband around the head. He came
  without the invitation and I thought, &quot;who in the hell is this guy?&quot;.</p>

  <p>A few days later, I burn my five-finger shoes in the parking lot outside the gym and are told to say: &ldquo;Bobby
  Maximus, I&rsquo;m sorry to mess with you by using these douchebag shoes&rdquo;. The video was then placed on his
  Instagram. Learned my lesson there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a man of you Freddie,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing my first test.&rdquo; 2K
  rowing, timed. &ldquo;The loser will be booted from Gym Jones forever!&rdquo;, cries Rob and we begin to calm down.</p>

  <p>I beat my opponent Viet, who is a celebrity cookie from Salt Lake City. Rob asks me:<br />
  - What time did you get?<br />
  - Seven minutes.<br />
  - No, what exact time?<br />
  - I&rsquo;m going forward, 7.00.4 minutes.<br />
  - You must be kidding with me?</p>

  <p>Gym Jones standard for 2K rowing is under seven minutes. I realize that if I&rsquo;m going to keep my honor,
  I&rsquo;ll have to get out of the box like the Phoenix. I hit the rowing machine again.</p>

  <p>Something I&rsquo;ve never experienced before. Instead of thinking, if I die I will never be ashamed, now I am
  thinking that I&rsquo;m doing it for my friends who believe in me. I make it in 6 minutes and 56 seconds. I have proven
  that I am motivated and willing to give it all, and I earned my right to stay.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Revolutionary suicide</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Gym Jones originates from American cult leader Jim Jones, known for mass assassination in November 1978 in Jonestown,
  when he managed to convince 918 of his members to commit &ldquo;revolutionary suicide&rdquo; through cyanide poisoning.
  To help their disciples achieve their best form ever, the Gym Jones system consists of a philosophy, methodology, and
  exercise. To quote their website, &ldquo;complete commitment to the task characterized by mobilizing all available
  resources to achieve a certain goal&rdquo;.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The film &ldquo;300&rdquo;&nbsp;succeeded recreating the image of&nbsp;Spartans as Greek gods&nbsp;chiseled from
  large blocks of marble</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Over the years, Gym Jones has abandoned a popular mass-production gym with a robotic style that is known by the
  masses. Founder Mark Twight refers this to the Globo-Gym mentality and his answer to the problem is to create an
  anti-gym of the gym where no free lunches are included, no shortcuts exist and no magic pill does work.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, it&rsquo;s impossible to get a better result in the second try if you gave 100% the first time. This
  phenomenon is common, so what is it that keeps us back? Have we inherited it from the Stone Age? Minimum resistance
  team? Or is that fear?</p>

  <p>The art of giving 100% is what distinguishes Gym Jones philosophy from other concepts out there. It is crucial to
  overcoming the mental barriers to perform better.</p>

  <p>When Professor Timothy Noakes began studying sports physiology, the general perception was that a muscle becomes
  tired due to the lack of energy or due to the build-up of excess lactic acid. But no one had proved that muscles were
  running out due to lack of oxygen or energy. &ldquo;Studies show, however, that people never use more than 50 percent of
  their muscle fibers, even during intensive training&rdquo;, says Prof. Noakes. The theories simply did not match
  reality.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Your brain sabotages your achievement.&nbsp;When you feel tired, it&rsquo;s only a feeling. It has nothing to do
  with your physical condition to do</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Eduardo Fontes, Ph.D. found that the limbic-emotional part of the brain illuminated under increased intensity and
  when cyclists became more tired. The more active limbic lobes, the more feelings were tied to fatigue and the result was
  that cyclists became slower. &ldquo;The key is not to judge the feelings as something positive or negative; that&rsquo;s
  when your brain sets limits&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>After spending two months at Gym Jones, I returned to Sweden. I call Mario Donato, the only certified Gym Jones
  instructor in Sweden. He has created a gym in Sweden, CMD (Center of Mass Destruction). I meet Mario on a snowy day at
  Motala train station and he gives me a welcome hug.</p>

  <p>- Lovely to see you, boy!</p>

  <p>Mario is temporarily home before returning to England to turn actors into superheroes for their role in Zack Snyders
  next movie. We drive straight to the gym.</p>

  <p>- I&rsquo;ve arranged something very special for you tonight!</p>

  <p>I feel the smell of nervousness. I am in a 200 square meter industrial area converted to a gym. Six people stand in a
  circle with staring eyes and receive instructions for the exercise. In 15 minutes, a lightning war of brutal exercises
  will convert hard into soft. The hip-hop music bounces against the walls adorned by laser-engraved metal boards
  representing Wolverine and the Hulk, while Mario walks around with a timer tied around his throat and shouts, &ldquo;If
  you&rsquo;re going to spit, you&rsquo;ll have to do it either in the toilet or in the bucket but not here!&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>- What are these people?<br />
  - Oh, here are all kinds of people. Sorry, Christy cannot be here tonight. The first time she came here, I asked her
  after the training session about what she thought. She pointed her finger, said &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; and threw the
  door afterward. One month later she came back and paid for a membership.</p>

  <p>It looks like any gym with the only exception that it&rsquo;s in the middle of nowhere. Empty. one in an industrial
  area in Motala. But here all the comparisons end. Everyone who comes to CMD wants to learn something from Gym
  Jones&rsquo;s philosophy and to quote Mario, &ldquo;the body is waiting for the mind to catch up.&rdquo;</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/health-fitness/body-waiting-mind-catch</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/health-fitness/body-waiting-mind-catch</guid><category><![CDATA[Health & Fitness]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 13:13:10 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Fredrik Sträng</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ferrari Portofino — Maranellos new hairdryer]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>The California T cabriolet has been replaced by the Portofino and Enliven took a trip along Route Napoleon in this
  new roofless Ferrari.</p>

  <p>The successor to Ferraris metal cabriolet California is unveiled and has been given the name Portofino which stems
  from the picturesque and luxurious fishing and summer resort of Liguria, Italy.</p>

  <p>The predecessor&#39;s name, California, originated from the iconic 250 GT California Spyder model built between
  1958-1963 with only 104 produced. If you want to buy a 250 GT California Spyder prepare to open up the wallet wide. It
  will set you back around $18 million on any of the more prestigious car auctions.</p>

  <p>The unveiling of Portofino was of course held in the Portofino harbor onboard a custom-built floating dock. Portofino
  being the home port of many of Europe&rsquo;s most exclusive luxury yachts,</p>

  <p>Ferrari Portofino is a so-called 2 + 2 cabriolet where the rear seats are suitable for dogs, bags or possibly a few
  underage kids. Underneath the hood we find the same turbocharged V8 engine that powers the 488 GTB and GT4 Lusso T. 600
  horsepower and 0-60 in 3.5 seconds with maximum velocity reached only when the needle passes 190 miles per hour.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Top speed is reached when the needle hits 190 mph</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the Portofino, Ferrari has put an incredible R&amp;D effort in getting the right feeling into acceleration, trying
  to eliminate &quot;turbo-lag&quot; as far as possible. In the development for the sound design of the engine Ferrari was
  seeking a sound image resembling a big orchestra &ndash; where you can enjoy everything from the bass to the
  soprano.</p>

  <p>Externally, a lot has changed since the predecessor of California. The car feels smaller and tighter in its frock,
  but both cars actually have the same axel width. On top of this the Portofino has gone on a diet and shredded 160
  pounds, which is great especially when combining this&nbsp;with the extra 40 BHP that the engine offer the driver.</p>

  <p>During this year&#39;s European tour with Gran Turismo Events, I was given the opportunity to test drive a Portofino
  owned by Olav Medhus from the Norwegian Ferrari dealer Autoxo.</p>

  <p>The stretch of road for the drive was the last part of the event between Monaco and Cannes, over the classic Route
  Napoleon. The road, is actually named Route Nationale 85, after Napoleon Bonaparte when he arrived in Golfe-Juan on
  March 1, 1815. Leaving his exile on the island of Elba, Napoleon was returning to the throne and quickly wanted to reach
  Lyon without having to face troops friendly to the old regime in the Rhone valley.</p>

  <p>The road runs north of the French Riviera and include&nbsp;some incredible sections with&nbsp;long&nbsp;winding and
  truly&nbsp;amazing mountain roads, a challenging drive also for the most experienced drivers. In other words, perfect
  for the Portofino and taking each curve was a delight.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Each curve is a delight in the Portofino</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The R&amp;D Ferrari put into the engine and the turbocharger has paid off, with power available in abundance. On the
  steering wheel, the lever called &quot;Manettino&quot; in Ferrari language, gives you three different and distinct
  driving modes, &quot;Comfort&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot; and &quot;ESC OFF&quot;.</p>

  <p>Each drastically changes the car&#39;s character, with the latter is intended for those who really know what they are
  doing. With the anti-skid system completely turned off, you get no help from the car if losing control. On these curvy
  roads when you want the car to be on its toes Sport is the best driving mode for most of us. A quick&nbsp;gas response,
  solid gearbox and harder suspension and chassi effortlessy helps you understand what&#39;s happening underneath the
  tires.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, Portofino has an electronic power steering as well as an electronic diff rear brake. This obviously affects
  the behavior positively on the road and gives you an incredibly good handling even in high speed and on the winding
  road, this despite having 600 horse powers&nbsp;on the rear tires.</p>

  <p>The interior has been going through a major update, even though you still can see clear resemblance to its
  predecessor. Something new is that you, as a passenger, have a small screen showing engine data such as RPM, speed,
  G-force and more. The screen came first in the FF model and is a fun detail. The leatherwork of Ferraris cars is always
  something extraordinary and Portofino is of course no exception. On top of the dashboard is a leather lining reminding
  you of the most exclusive luxury bags.</p>

  <p>The fan outlets are made of thin metal and feels extremely lavish. Instead of regular carpeting, your feet are
  positioned on perforated aluminum plates. Very stylish and similar to those in racing cars. As with many other Ferrari
  models, there is no ordinary gearbox but a center console with three-buttons; &quot;R&quot;, for reverse,
  &quot;Auto&quot; to return to automatic mode if you have chosen to start manually switching with the paddles on the
  steering wheel, as well as &quot;Launch&quot; for launch control and that gives you an optimal sprint from
  standstill.</p>

  <p>Thanks to its metal retractable roof, the Portofino is a nice drive also with the roof up. However, I do not explore
  this further this hot and sunny day.</p>

  <p>Ferrari Portofino is a car for your regular hedonist with a big wallet. This is definitely the Ferrari model you
  should pick if you love fantastic driving,&nbsp; but at the same time you want a car that works even when weather is at
  its worse. You can say that Ferrari Portofino is the perfect everyday car. If this makes Enzo Ferrari turn in his grave
  or possibly applaud, I will leave unsaid.</p>

I
  went to photograph these majestic animals.</p>

  <p>It took me four days to get to Vava&#39;u due to bad weather. This also made it difficult to spot the whales, with
  strong winds, big waves and swells stirring up the sea impairing visibility. Eventually I started spotting some of the
  infamous sea-life, including Spinner dolphins, Pilot whales and finally Humpbacks. There were several adult males
  alongside pregnant mothers and calves.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;<em>I was lucky to witness a heat run, which involved eight males showing-off in front of a female</em></p>

  <p>The males move fast often changing direction, breaching, blowing bubbles and slapping their tails on the surface. The
  best way to describe this is to imagine a snow-globe (with whales) being shaken.</p>

  <p>I continued my journey to Fonuafo`ou, an uninhabited island approximately 90km north of Tongatapu (mainland Tonga). I
  camped on the remote island overnight in solitude, I was completely removed from everything.</p>

  <p>The island is a haven for birds that live in the small central thicket, which is surrounded only by a few meters of
  sandy beach. The shallows that encompass the island lead into a reef full of fish, including reef sharks.</p>

  apartment where design meets personality.</p>

  <p>Former decor editor Juliette Arrighi de Casanova launched her lifestyle brand Juj Living&nbsp;in 2017. Since then,
  her name and her creations have become synonymous in Cape Town where she is based&nbsp;with a fiercely eclectic and
  layered aesthetic.</p>

  <p>When Arrighi de Casanova purchased her micro apartment (a mere 47m2 which by South African standards is minuscule),
  she was gifted the challenge to complete&nbsp;her first Juj Living interiors&nbsp;project from scratch. Bought off-plan,
  the initial shell was limited in terms of materials and budget.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>I opted for a few upgrades like a wood-look vinyl on the floors with a charcoal-stain appearance</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;New cupboard handles and jute carpeting in the bedroom were installed along with&nbsp;mirror-cladding and a
  hand shower above a bath that was not originally specified on the plans&rdquo;.&nbsp;All these additions culminating in
  a modern bijou apartment for a young and optimistic interior designer.</p>

  <p>Arrighi de Casanova had the vision to create a space closest to that of a boutique hotel suite. Each piece of
  furniture is original and tells a story. Vibrant colors and unexpected patterns and textures sing in perfect harmony.
  She tends to an arrangement of multi-colored blooms in a Delft vase she purchased in Amsterdam.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>I consider animal print a neutral and I&#39;m a total maximalist</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This unique approach to a small space, of adding rather than subtracting, is more nuanced than one thinks.
  Here,&nbsp;Arrighi de Casanova founds her decorative layering on a canvas of black and white and other&nbsp;neutral
  materials and&nbsp;finishes such as soft grey marble mosaic tiles&nbsp;and&nbsp;white Belgian linen curtains.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The moss-green sofa is a copy from a project she worked on with the mentor, interior designer Andrea Graff who is
  celebrated for her imaginative and wildly creative approach to interiors.</p>

  <p>Gaining invaluable experience from her years working under Graff&#39;s guidance, Arrighi de Casanova learned to take
  risks and think outside the box. A fine example of this is the custom&nbsp;wallpaper designed from her blue and white
  Chinoiserie dinnerware. &ldquo;I know it&#39;s a mad choice but I just love it! It makes me so happy and it&#39;s the
  perfect combination of old and new, which I have always been drawn to&rdquo;, she swoons.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This masterful mix of vintage and contemporary was born out of necessity. Arrighi de Casanova had to make inherited
  pieces work within a new build. She also had to consider the multi-functionality of furniture pieces, doubling her
  vintage Saarinen Tulip table into a workstation and utilizing her outdoor stools as additional surface areas when
  entertaining indoors.</p>

  <p>She did not restrain herself with the scale of things and believes that bigger is better in a small space. The
  central focus always being coziness and keeping the eye interested.</p>

  <p>This sense of comfort and warmth all comes down to the layering of color and texture, creating different lines and
  individual vignettes.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>No corner is left empty, no wall space is disregarded</em></p>
  </blockquote>

Once home to a few farmers dating their heritage back to the
  Vikings of the 9th century, the place is now totally uninhabited — in the middle of the last century, people moved away. 
  For four days we see no-one, but birds and foxes.</p>

  <p>I had no clue of what to expect when photographer Fredrik Schenholm invited me to Iceland, a place he
  enthusiastically loves. In fact so much so, he insists calling it Niceland.</p>

  <p>Iceland is famed for unique sights, like sources of steam and boiling water called Geysirs, tamed at recreational
  parks like The Blue Lagoon. Another thing that comes to mind is action-injecting activities like heli-skiing or white
  water rafting and cruising on glaciers and volcanic dirt with snowmobiles, quads and super jeeps. And of course fishing,
  at sea, and inland with dry flies. That may all be cool stuff, but Fredrik wanted to venture beyond the easy
  thrills.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Hornstrandir offers a contrast to Iceland&#39;s sort of mass-tourism</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Uninhabited since the 1950s, and vast relative to the number of visitors, it offers a haven for large populations of
  birds and a sense of tranquillity rarely experienced for the few people who choose to spend time there. We had set out
  in June, still a month before the main season and expected our timing to further amplify our isolation.</p>

  <p>Our journey took us by plane from Reykjavik to the small fishing village Isafjordur. From here we took a regular boat
  service to the abandoned whaling station Hesteyri. Most tourists on the boat spend some time here before getting back on
  the boat. A coffee and some supplies can be bought here.</p>

  <p>A few steps later we were on our own. A sort of narrow path appeared to once have been a road built before horsepower
  produced any exhaust. But gradually the road merged into a path, that soon more or less disappeared. No-one followed
  behind us, and no sign of humans could be seen in front of us, as we crossed over a mountain plateau and took in the
  view of the Atlantic Ocean below.</p>

  <p>Somewhere behind the horizon is Greenland. It was in the following hours we got an idea of the size of the peninsula,
  as we spotted a sandy beach. Our planned camping site was at the far side of the beach. A stream split the beach in two
  as it cut its way through the treeless flats below us.</p>

  <p>Hours later our naked feet waded across the river. What had looked like a tiny, silvery string of water was now
  hundred-wide meters of sheer cold. Being used to the 1:25000 maps of the Alps, distances are four times longer when
  using the 1:100000 map of Hornstrandir, a scale typically used in wilder, larger environments. It&rsquo;s not as if we
  did not know that, but the cold water put it into the proper perspective&hellip;</p>

  <p>That beach was long. As we continued our stroll across the fine sand we later could make out some colors that did not
  quite fit in, we had reached a few houses, remains from the 50s. The houses are still used, but now only as
  summer-cabins for the children of the previous owners. We had reached Adalvik.</p>

  <p>The day after we continued eastwards. An old road ascends the northern part of this short valley. It leads to an
  abandoned radar station established by the Americans at a place called Straumsnes. Soon we took off from it and set our
  course for the next valley, a place called Flj&oacute;tavik. The walk would offer what we learned was a typical day on
  these hills. Some 500 meters of vertical ascent and descent, and a distance of anything from 10 to 20 km.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As soon as we had gained a few hundred meters of elevation, the mist would often approach from the nearby ocean.
  Cairns tended to be small and few. This made staying on trail tricky. It may be, that later in the summer, when the main
  holiday season kicks in, the trail gets beaten down a bit more, and it may then be easier not to lose your bearings. We
  sometimes had to keep the compass handy to keep going in the proper direction.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>From time to time shy foxes ran across the hills</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Under us, the beach is white as far as our eyes can see. As we approach we understand that the color is not due to
  coral-sand, but tons of sun-bleached driftwood. We approach and explore the big piles.</p>

  <p>How did it get here, is my first thought, but the question is not too tricky. Natures forces are strong, and these
  are timber that has fallen into Siberian rivers and brought out to sea. Then the current has pulled it across the icy
  North Pole.</p>

  <p>Most of the coastline at the peninsula is near-vertical but here it is possible for strong tides and waves to deposit
  the logs more than 20 meters above the water below us.&nbsp;We climb on to the logs, struggling to keep our balance as
  we explore what the ocean has tossed ashore.</p>

  <p>Some of the wood is shaped with tools, some of it is painted. Fishing gear like ropes, nets and floats are
  everywhere. Most of it may be lost without any drama, but it&rsquo;s hard not to contemplate the forces that rule the
  cold waters north of this place, and is able to spit wreckage high up onto this shore.</p>

  <p>As long as a millennium before us, the Vikings sailed here to gather firewood, a useful resource supplied to this
  treeless land by the ocean currents. We camp by a river-rapid for the night, there are no burn marks from the driftwood,
  and we take care to leave the place as we found it.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>It&rsquo;s strange having a feeling that we might be the first people ever to visit this place while being aware
  of the history of human presence dating back a thousand years</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To continue the journey we have to wait for the low tide, and then walk on a narrow wet beach with cliffs on our
  right. We then approach the final part of our journey, having to cross the biggest river in the area. Fortunately it has
  by now become routine, but this one is slightly deeper, and to make sure to keep everything dry we balance the backpacks
  on top of our heads.</p>

  <p>Our journey nears its end when we get to Hornberg, where a group of scientist and volunteers monitor the arctic foxes
  that thrive in the area. An important explanation to their wellbeing is the vast population of different species of
  birds that seek refuge on the steep hillsides of the 400&nbsp;meters high Hornberg. For our last day we set out to pay a
  visit to the cliffs where the birds live.</p>

  <p>Below we can see the boat dock, and a small group of people following in our tracks. I like the idea of getting to
  cliffs in front of the tourists, that way we can acclimatize ourselves gradually to reentry to urban life, and pay our
  farewells to this special landscape. It takes a little more than half an hour to get to the top of the cliff.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The wall drop vertically some five hundred meters below us</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I toss a rock. Counting the seconds. Fredrik wants me to stand close to the edge, for some photos. I&rsquo;ve always
  been very fond of flying. The possibility to travel great distances. The strict demands to performance that apply to
  aviation.</p>

  <p>The seagulls appear to be masters. They hitch free rides with the air flow pushed upwards when the wind from the sea
  hit the cliffs. Their wings change constantly to create any shapes like winglets, long sailplane-like wings or stubby
  fighter plane-wings.</p>

  <p>When we first came here it looked a bit like chaos, but studying the individual birds I start to suspect they are not
  flying only because they want to. When performing snap rolls and other maneuvers associated with dogfights and the
  acrobatic flight I suspect they are in love with flying.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/adventure-expeditions-skiing-trekking/hornstrandir-surrounded-wilderness</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/adventure-expeditions-skiing-trekking/hornstrandir-surrounded-wilderness</guid><category><![CDATA[Adventure & Expeditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Trekking]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2018 20:00:16 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Fredrik Schenholm, Tormod Granheim</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Conservation Heroes III — The public]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>Each day brings us closer to turning the tide against poaching, and each rhino that we save notches another victory
  thanks in part to the groundswell of citizen activism and participation in conservation. Thanks to you.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <p>5 am. Autumn in the Kruger National Park. The piercing rattle of a metal spoon against a frying pan echoes through
  the camp, bringing with it the promise of an unforgettable experience. The dawn air is fresh, gently fragranced with
  smoldering coals from the night before. Guests emerge from their tents and ready themselves to embark on a rhino capture
  exercise out in the Kruger Park.</p>

  <p>Unfenced and unfiltered; theirs is a front-row view of a most exhilarating and sobering event, conducted by a team of
  consummate and dedicated professionals. An early morning game drive delivers the barely-woke guest to the rendezvous
  point where they will meet with the group of rangers and response teams.</p>

  <p>This is the softer side to the anti-poaching campaign; an access point for citizens to embrace, learn and spread
  awareness. It&rsquo;s where all aspects of the conservation movement come together; the honorary rangers, the ranger
  corps, veterinary and conservation professionals, and the public.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Rhino capture events are a form of ecotourism that allows conservation services to monitor the rhino population,
  collect blood and DNA samples, perform any veterinary functions and fit tracking devices</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For the average person though, it is a very rare opportunity for a close and personal encounter with a rhino in its
  natural habitat. The chance to enjoy a thrilling low flying helicopter sweep over the park is equally attractive.</p>

  <p>To capture a rhino, an aerial search is conducted to find a suitable candidate. When located, the rhino is darted
  with a specially formulated morphine derivative which immobilizes without rendering it unconscious.&nbsp;Once in full
  effect, the drug will give the team up to one hour to work on the animal.</p>

  <p>It can take several minutes for the rhino to fully metabolize the drug, during which the helicopter pilot executes
  precision low-flying maneuvers, guiding the animal ever closer to an access point where the response team and guests can
  approach it safely and expediently.</p>

  <p>For first-time participants this situation is quite breathtaking; the noise and turbulence of created by a helicopter
  in combination with a distressed and drowsy animal trying desperately to evade capture.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>As soon as the animal loses its footing a member of the response team approaches carefully from behind to drape a
  towel over its eyes, while others begin to secure the rhino with ropes</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The tagging and veterinary procedures commence immediately as time is of the essence. A prolonged state of immobility
  can compromise organ function particularly the rhinos capacity to regulate its body temperature.</p>

  <p>The guests are invited to explore the scene and come into contact with the rhino. Very little can prepare one for
  that first touch; the gritty, leathery heaving body of a sedated rhino can be overwhelming. It is the texture of a
  natural beauty, of raw power and ultimately one of immense vulnerability. It is not long before we must all withdraw
  from the scene, and return to the safety of the vehicles.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The vet clears the area and administered an antidote to counter the effects of the sedating drug. Within a minute
  the rhino rises back to its feet</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A somewhat unsteady and disorientated rhino gages her surrounds in an attempt to decode the foreign shapes, scents
  and sounds. Many tear-filled eyes stare on in awe, as some marvel in the beauty of the beast, yet others come to terms
  with its fragility and role we as a species have played in determining the fate of this animal.</p>

  <p>We can draw much hope from these encounters. For one, the funds raised by such eco-tourism initiatives are
  invaluable, and furthermore, participants gain unique insight and are well positioned to spread the awareness of
  anti-poaching and conservation efforts in general.</p>

  <p>Around the country, various reserves and parks offer similar encounter opportunities. They are hugely beneficial to
  the ongoing management and protection of endangered species and well worth looking into.</p>

  <p>I offer sincere gratitude and the greatest respect to the faithful servants of conservation; the rangers, pilots,
  veterinary doctors, and the highly skilled support crew who have afforded me the opportunity to create this
  story.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/history-nature/conservation-heroes-iii-public</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/history-nature/conservation-heroes-iii-public</guid><category><![CDATA[History & Nature]]></category><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 09:12:05 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Ravi Gajjar</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Conservation Heroes II — The Ranger Corps]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>The ranger corps forms the load bearing frontline that work tirelessly to resist the surge of poacher activity within
  the borders of the Kruger National Park in South Africa.</p>

  <p>There&rsquo;s a quiet, steely and highly focused resolve, a brand of acute determination that is at once thrilling
  and calming. Perhaps it is the look in their eyes, or the weapons they wield. It might very well be their peak mental
  and physical condition.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Fourteen days. That is the length of time a special ranger can be deployed in the bush. With ad-hoc support to
  refuel rations and water, special rangers are routinely deployed for three, five or seven days depending on the mission
  criteria</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Judicious use of supplies may extend a set of rations for up to two days. Hydration, however, remains a challenge,
  particularly in the harsh lowveld environment where summer temperatures average 32&deg;C peaking at 40&deg;C.</p>

  <p>Constantly on the move, exposed to fierce predators, other wild animals and the risk of contact situations with
  poachers, the special ranger is a one-of-a-kind operational resource. They possess a level of compassion and an
  understanding of the human condition that may seem out of place in these circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Elsewhere in the bush, day or night and often both, other rangers and their K-9 units scour the bush, tracking spoor
  and operating on incursion reports and various other forms of intelligence. The scenarios they engage are highly
  unpredictable and often volatile. Their objective is simple; apprehend the suspects with minimal loss of human and
  animal lives.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>It is a race against time, and all too often, a race that is lost as they arrive at a (crime) scene dressed with
  the blood and mutilated remains of yet another rhino</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Further up the chain of command, the section ranger must keep a finger pressed firmly against the pulse. A
  responsibility that ultimately determines the integrity of their section of the park. The Kruger National Park has 22
  sections, with each section covering slightly less than 900,000 square kilometers. While the section ranger is a
  leadership role, it is by no means an oversight role, as section rangers operate alongside rangers whenever the need
  arises.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It is easy to imagine these individuals as soldiers; instruments of a military response to an enemy offensive. One is
  readily drawn to focus on the tactical features of their presence in the park. It is important though to recognize that
  the ranger corps is a committed, highly skilled and knowledgeable group of men and women that are
  true&nbsp;conservationists at heart.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/history-nature/conservation-heroes-ii-ranger-corps</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/history-nature/conservation-heroes-ii-ranger-corps</guid><category><![CDATA[History & Nature]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2018 13:05:23 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Ravi Gajjar</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bread With Autumn Nettles and Feta Cheese]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>When the fall creeps in, we get inspired by the forest. Nettles can be picked long into the fall and they are filled

Meet Renske, a Vancouver-based
  Dutch writer and illustrator.</p>

  <p>It was a casual drawing while on holiday that changed the course of Renske Werner&#39;s career. A talent that came
  naturally &mdash;and was, therefore, discounted by the artist&mdash;&nbsp;suddenly sprung into her forefront. From her
  Vancouver studio, the illustrator answers Enliven&#39;s questions about inspiration and&nbsp;workspace.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em>What made you want to become&nbsp;an illustrator?</em></p>

  <p>I became an illustrator because it was a passion I really wanted to pursue. I have always been drawn to making and
  crafting and while I love the process, the results of painting or making jewelry were never satisfying. This changed
  three years ago when I felt inspired to draw something with only a black felt-tip pen and a piece of paper at my
  disposal. I drew one of those wicker-woven hanging chairs, a&nbsp;furniture piece that was on my wishlist. Then I added
  some art on a wall, a drawer unit in the background, and cozy blankets and pillows in the chair.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>The results of painting or making jewelry were never satisfying</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The simple mediums of pen and paper really spoke to me and the fine-tipped pen allowed me to explore my love for
  detail. It was this simple drawing that marked the start of my path to becoming an illustrator. I didn&rsquo;t stop
  liking the scene I drew and that was a significant first.</p>

  <p><em>Let&#39;s talk about the workspace. Do you have your own studio, where to &#39;be in peace&#39;, or are&nbsp;you
  sharing it&nbsp;with other creators?</em></p>

  <p>I work at a co-working space for creatives. It is a beautiful space with lots of plants, white walls and white
  floors. The community of creatives, the collaborations and opportunities I got to be a part of because of this space
  have been imperative in my pursuit to become an illustrator.</p>

  <p><em>What are the pros and cons of being an illustrator in Vancouver?</em></p>

  <p>It&#39;s great. There are pockets of creative communities all over the city, but since the overall local creative
  community is quite small, collaborations are often the norm. There are loads of markets for crafters and makers and
  everyone seems to offer support where possible.</p>

  <p><em>What inspires you&nbsp;the most?</em></p>

  <p>I enjoy noticing the details in the environment around me, whether it&#39;s how leaves on a tree look in a certain
  light, or how I perceive a painting in a museum. People inspire me too -&nbsp;their stories, their lifestyle. Sometimes
  I need a dose of Pinterest or Instagram for inspiration, other times I simply start drawing and I let the process
  inspire me.</p>

  <p><em>How do you describe your illustrations?</em></p>

  <p>As a delightful pause. I want to evoke a happy feeling with my work. This feeling can be found in the details of my
  work, or a playful naiveness in the perspective. I want to create a pause in people&#39;s busy days. My illustrations
  are predominantly line-work in black and white, with a colorful exception.</p>

  <p><em>What materials do you use for your&nbsp;work?</em></p>

  <p>Before I used&nbsp;fine-tipped felt pens and paper, but I transitioned to drawing in Procreate on the iPad. It&#39;s
  a wonderful way to work digitally, without losing the tactile process of working analog. All I need is my iPad, my Apple
  Pencil and I am good to go.</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/contemporary-art/coffee-renske-werner</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/contemporary-art/coffee-renske-werner</guid><category><![CDATA[Contemporary Art]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2018 10:10:32 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Sara Solana, Renske Werner</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fast and Furious on Gotland with the Nissan GT- R  ]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p>More comfortable and powerful, we have enjoyed and experienced the fall in Gotland while driving the Nissan <span
  class="caps">GT</span>- R.</p>

  <p>The car that completely put the supercar segment into sway when 2007 replaced the already powerful Nissan Skyline
  GT-R.</p>

  <p><br />
  No matter what people like the shapes, technology or Nissan restrictions, GT-R is among the fastest you can buy for less
  than a million SEK. It can also match against most supercars on the market, which in some cases costs twice as much, if
  not more. Gotland during the summer months in all honor, sun, bath and always a fun party to dance the shirt off to
  sunrise.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;GT-R quickly got the nickname Godzilla because of its distintive&nbsp;forms&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><br />
  But one week in October, there is an island in a completely different way, because the summer visitors have left to go
  home&nbsp;and the beautiful roads lie virtually empty all over the island. Therefore, we took the new Nissan
  GT-R&nbsp;to truly experience the&nbsp;roads and beautiful places in peace and quiet.<br />
  <br />
  The V6 engine in GT-R is double-tipped and 3.8 liters. The effect is now 570 horses, which is almost 100
  horsepowers&nbsp;more than the original version presented. The sprint from zero to hundred takes just 2.8 seconds, which
  is a tenth faster than Lamborghini Aventador, a car that costs just over 300 thousand dollars.<br />
  <br />
  By contrast, the Nissan GT-R can not measure up to the top speed of Lamborghini and will look overlooked when the meter
  reaches 315 kilometers per hour. However, this&nbsp;statistics is for the second to last generation of the GT-R and
  Nissan has not wanted to disclose the top speed for the new generation.<br />
  <br />
  However, the fact that the TG-R&nbsp;is fast is not to be doubted, especcialy&nbsp;when we take it to a secluded road
  which&nbsp;usually is used for street racing. Secluded with almost no traffic you can let the GT-R stretch out, without
  worrying about one or the other...</p>

  <p>As the journey goes from the southernmost tip of Gotland, the roads are wonderfully varied with curves and straight
  stretches. The new GT-R is more snug and has a comfortable position on the dampers. Together with the enhanced
  Bos&eacute; sound system, long trips are very comfortable. But it&#39;s not really what we are here to experience. With
  the dampers set to the R and gearbox in manual mode, each millimeter is maximized in the curves.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><br />
  &ldquo;The Nissan GT-R is brutally fast and accurate, nothing stands the way for its drive thanks to a highly efficient
  anti-slip system and four-wheel drive&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><br />
  A bit north of the island is Gotland Ring, one of Sweden&#39;s absolute best racing tracks. Inspired by the
  N&uuml;rburgring in Germany, the track offers challenging curves and straight stretches. A day pass here costs 1 585 SEK
  and an annual card of 6 500 SEK. The course is open for public driving virtually every weekend year-round if weather
  permits.<br />
  <br />
  The trip continues northwards and by ferry to F&aring;r&ouml;. Here the roads lie more lonely and out along the coast,
  the scenery on scenes makes it difficult to understand that they are in Sweden. At the far end of the northeast, we
  reach F&aring;r&ouml; Lighthouse. This will be the end of a speedy and highly adrenaline-filled journey.<br />

  eternity and wondered if those hills might harbour trails and singletrack possibilities…</p>

  <p>I leave our Riad in Marrakesh and walk through narrow alleys aiming for the main square. A square far removed from
  barren benches, cultural emptiness and banned street musicians. Jemaa el-Fnaa is a legendary place- a busy and vibrant
  melting pot of colour, music and smells that is almost worth the trip in itself.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>A fantasy vision of North African exotica full of music, storytelling, fortune tellers, snake charmers and
  full-on thirst for commerce</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I&#39;m fascinated by how little has changed in the ten years that have passed since my last visit. The freshly
  squeezed orange juice might cost a few cents more but otherwise it&#39;s largely unchanged, except for the slightly
  hipper feel to it all.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>But although urban escapades in all their glory have a time and a place, I&#39;m not here to hang out with French
  hipsters or splurge on home interior. This time Morocco has something else up it&rsquo;s sleeve and on a clear day its
  visible from Marrakesh: The Atlas Mountains. The mountain range that cuts right across North Africa, from Morocco,
  through Algeria over to Tunisia.</p>

  <p>The day is still clear and pleasantly warm when we set off towards the mountains. After readying our bikes, we start
  a steep climb through a village where the adhan, the Islamic call to worship, ads some extra flavour to our sequential
  pushbiking.</p>

  <p>Friendly children from the village accompany us and some insist on helping us out, obviously with hopes of candy or
  coins. Soon we get our first view of the lower Atlas and its unfolding hills and valleys, dimly veiled in a beautiful
  haze.</p>

  <p>A mellow trail, a mule path, takes us down between fields and through villages but as we approach the village of
  Tinzert the increasingly technical trail demands our full attention. Since we have no intention of faceplanting a
  ploughed field lined with muledroppings, we have to ride carefully and pick the right line amidst the furrows.</p>

  <p>This is our first taste of what&#39;s to come. The villages here are still home to a vibrant Berber culture and many
  are only connected to the outside world by these mule paths.&nbsp;For centuries these tracks have been trampled by pack
  animals and they still have a key role in the infrastructure of this mountain community.</p>

  <p>The paths will change character throughout the week. Sometimes they are wide, smooth and delicate. Sometimes, perhaps
  primarily as we approach the villages, they are considerably worn and tricky - incredibly fun if you have the technique,
  skill and courage to ride them. The mountainous landscape is a display of deep gorges and rocky cliffs. In the midst of
  it all the ochre villages blend in completely with the natural environment.</p>

  <p>Our main base during the coming week is a small lodge near the village of Ouirgane which offers a swimming pool that
  is as cold as the beer, but the generous dinners, hot showers and open fires are a welcome luxury now that winter is
  approaching.</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>The following day we drive uphill for nearly an hour, passing the trekking hub of Imlil to the pass of Tizi
  n&#39;Tamartert at over 2000 meters altitude.&nbsp;Rising above us is the snow-capped Toubkal massive, crowned by a
  4167m peak, North Africa&#39;s highest point.</p>

  <p>We are now deep in the Atlas Mountains. A blue sky is resting on the mountains and autumn trees glimmer in the sun.
  Everything blends harmoniously, the houses in the villages the sand and stones.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>We are a mixed bunch; Swedes, Britons, Germans and Australians</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the lead is our guide Jon Bawn. Perhaps because it&rsquo;s beyond the harvest season, or perhaps because winter is
  coming, there are few others on these well-worn and ancient paths. We ride a rough trail that takes us down a deep
  valley. Sometimes the trail is fairly exposed and the slight risk of falling requires its share of balancing
  skills.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We have a support jeep that waits for us at road crossings and keeps an eye on us from a distance. Part of me can not
  help to think that there is something absurd about it. When would you ever have a jeep following when you are biking at
  home? But I surrender at the first lunch.</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p>We pause at a riverbed outside the village Imsker. Groups of women from the village have gathered by the river to do
  their laundry, just like time was standing still. While we rest and soak up the sun, our chef Ahmed and our eminent
  local guide Hamou serve up a hearty buffet. What a blissful luxury to skip those sweaty energy bars and sticky sports
  drinks and instead indulge in a lunch with fresh vegetables, freshly baked bread and delicious omelette.</p>

  <p>When we leave Imsker, the village children gather around us. They cheer, clap and give us high fives. It is the same
  in almost every village we pass. The huge welcome and the joy we encounter here is truly heart warming and one of many
  memories to keep.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Atlas Mountains are named after the Greek Titan Atlas. After a defeat in battle he was first forced to carry the
  heavens on his shoulders and was later turned into this mountain range. Whether true or not, there is certainly a
  heavenly feel to this place.</p>

  <p>Although every day is packed with adventures and incredible riding, one day in particular will be etched in my mind
  more than any other. At Amislane we climb up to a mountain pass again of over 2000m. Our bikes sketch lines in the thin
  layer of newly fallen snow, and soon a technical trail bring us down through a winding valley rich in fruit trees and
  gardens. Outside the village of Tizgui, we enrol some traditional furry four-legged shuttle experts.</p>

  <p>A team of mules and porters help our bikes up and over a mountain pass while we try to keep pace by foot. This is not
  the most common of sights but here the mules are central to Berber culture, and our bikes weigh only a fraction of what
  the mules are capable of carrying. I take this as a small consolation. After dropping down through a narrow ravine lined
  with yellow autumn trees we continue our walk through a rough but gorgeous canyon.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Then the landscape expands. The path is diffuse and the ground is different from previous days. Now it&#39;s more
  like driving off-piste down a giant stable cairn. Here, the risk of falling is non-existent and the brakes get some much
  needed siesta as we let gravity do its thing. After six hours we recharge with another epic lunch and soon it turns out
  that we still have the absolute best in front of us, not only for today but for the whole week.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>We reach what is promised to be an epic singletrack of world class quality</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I team up with Lewis, a British rider that matches me in riding style. This kind of magic trail should not be enjoyed
  alone but shared and ridden in tune. We hold nothing back as we take the lead, racing ahead. It&rsquo;s a classic
  singletrack with just the right amount of slope, cutting across the mountain side, steadily downhill for almost 10
  km.</p>

  <p>However, it&rsquo;s constantly exposed to the left and if we fall down, we will probably not stop until one of the
  thorny junipers catches us. But the grip dry, stable and hard surface delivers the best grip during the whole week.</p>

  <p>The bushes also contribute to an enhanced speed sensation. It pure pleasure and we get jacked on endorphins and
  adrenaline. We stop to wait up for the others, turn our heads and gaze out over the rolling hills, now with the
  knowledge that here in Morocco, these hills harbour trails and endless singletrack possibilities&hellip;</p>]]></description><link>https://www.enliven.co/stories/cycling/riding-high-atlas-morocco</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.enliven.co/stories/cycling/riding-high-atlas-morocco</guid><category><![CDATA[Cycling]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2018 10:00:01 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator>Daniel Breece</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[No Stress in Okinawa]]></title><description><![CDATA[  <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The islands of Okinawa are located south of mainland Japan, surrounded by the
  East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. A social and healthy lifestyle makes the people in the archipelago reach the
  highest ages in the world.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">Street life in Naha is full of activity. The capital city of Okinawa Prefecture is home to about
  300 000 people and is the biggest city in the Okinawa Prefecture. </p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">Often overlooked by cities on the mainland, it is in fact one of the most interesting cities in
  Japan. The city offers good shopping, especially of food products. The main landmark is the Kokusai-dori, or
  international road which runs straight through the city centre and is packed with vendors selling tropical fruits like
  dragon fruit, papaya, mango, pineapple and the famous shiquaasa, a lime-like citrus fruit. </p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">At the Makishi public market vendors sell locally produced seaweed-products and sea grapes; also
  called green caviar. A smoked sea snake is hanging from the ceiling and the local habu snake &ndash; popular with mainly
  Chinese tourists, is found throughout the market. </p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">A big plate of fresh sashimi is not only a feast for the palate, but at three euro, also for the
  wallet. If you like ice cream, head to Blue Seal which has the most famous ice cream in Okinawa and odd flavours like
  salt cookie and purple sweet potato. </p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">Many people think of Kobe beef as the best Japanese meat but Okinawa has it&rsquo;s own prized
  beef: Ishigaki beef, named after the island of Ishigaki in the Okinawa Prefecture. At Retro Steak House in Naha the vibe
  will take you back to the 60&rsquo;s, but rather than retro, the place is well preserved. You definitely come her for
  the juicy steaks. </p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">When you want to get out of the city take a daytrip to Kerama Islands National Park, which
  consists of a cluster of about 20 islands &ndash; about 35 kilometres west of Okinawa main island, including four
  inhabited rainforest covered islands. Beautiful emerald green waters and visibility to a depth of 50 meters makes the
  area a great diving spot.</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p><b><span lang="EN-GB">Beach life and corals</b></p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">When you want a beach close to Naha, head to Bibi Beach &ndash; a short car ride away. White sand
  and turquoise water makes it ideal for an afternoon hangout. Iesha Llewellyn from Wales is working in a parasailing shop
  located near the water&rsquo;s edge. <b>&ldquo;</b>I&rsquo;m living on a beach, it&rsquo;s very laid back,&rdquo; she
  says. </p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">The islands also have underwater adventures. Several dive operators offer scuba diving at the
  archipelago&rsquo;s coral reefs. Due to global warming Okinawa has experienced coral bleaching, like in many other parts
  of the world. Replanting of corals along the islands coastline is trying to tackle the problem. Washed up corals are
  still used in an ancient dying style called Bingata &ndash; where corals were used to dye clothes &ndash; in the
  Okinawan culture.</p>

  <p><b><span lang="EN-GB">Oldest people in the world</b></p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">Okinawa is foremost famous for its old population; the citizens reach the highest ages in the
  world &ndash; mostly due to active lifestyles and a healthy diet. This is specifically true in &ldquo;the longevity
  village&rdquo; of Ogimi on the northern part of the main island. The village has about 3200 people and 156 of the
  villagers are between 90 and 105 years old. </p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">We visit when the village celebrates a birthday party in the public community hall. Yaeko Miyagi
  is turning 88 &ndash; a lucky number seen as a threshold to longevity. The secret behind a long life? Access to gardens
  where the elderly grow their own vegetables like Goya, which is a bitter lemon. It&rsquo;s the symbol of Okinawa&rsquo;s
  vegetables and contains twice as much vitamin C as lemon. </p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">Activities such as farming also keep the inhabitants fit through daily exercise.<span
  lang="EN-GB"> Because people live close to nature and the weather is warm year-round, it is easy for the elderly to do
  outside activities.</p>

  <div class="page-break-after"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</div>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">It is very common that children do sports after school from a young age and elderly play gate-ball
  (Japanese croquet) with friends. Also, people often go down to the ocean to catch some seafood such as clams and
  seaweeds as well as grow their own vegetables.</p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">The social network is important; people interact and lend things and money to each other when
  needed. Moai is one of the unique things about Okinawa; that you won&rsquo;t see in mainland Japan. Essentially, moai
  are informal groups formed by people who won&#39;t cooperate with each other. Members of these ad hoc co-ops commit to
  offering emotional, social or even financial assistance to one another. </p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">While moai are often practical in their collaborative purposes, they also provide a way for men
  and women to share stress during difficult times and to serve as a sort of extended family. Being a member of a moai
  offers people everything from long term friendships to group problem solving, from financing a business to responding to
  a personal crisis. </p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">Yaeko Miyagi skips meat and keeps her diet of fish and vegetables</p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">- <em></em><span lang="EN-GB"><em>I eat three meals a day, get up early and go to bed early</em>,
  she says.</p>

  <p><span lang="EN-GB">Taking care of the family&rsquo;s finances makes her &ldquo;using the brain&rdquo;. Daily talks
  with friends keep her alert.<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<em></em><em><span lang="EN-GB">And I drink tea with the younger
  generation as often as possible</em></p>

  <p><b><span lang="EN-GB">Facts:</b></p>

  <p><sup><span lang="EN-GB">Okinawa has a subtropical climate and consists of 160 islands of which 40 are inhabited. The
  population is about 1,5 million. The average age is 87 for women and 79 for men. Okinawa has the highest centenarian
  ratios in the world: with 60 per 100 000 people. Tourism is the biggest sector, with seven million tourists a year,
